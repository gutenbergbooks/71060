<p>In preparing the present edition of the <span class="smcap">Anatomy

pains to render the work as complete as possible.
Some parts have been re-written, some new facts
added, and several inaccuracies, which had crept
into the former editions, rectified. Altogether, I
am in hopes that this impression will be considered
an improvement upon its predecessors, and that
no fact of any importance has been overlooked

</div>

<p>Drunkenness is not, like some other vices, peculiar
to modern times. It is handed down to us from
“hoar antiquity;” and, if the records of the antediluvian
era were more complete, we should probably
find that it was not unknown to the remotest ages of
the world. The cases of Noah and Lot, recorded in
the sacred writings, are the earliest of which tradition
or history has left any record; and both occurred
in the infancy of society. Indeed, wherever the
grape flourished, inebriation prevailed. The formation
of wine from this fruit, was among the earliest
discoveries of man, and the bad consequences thence
resulting, seem to have been almost coeval with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
discovery. Those regions whose ungenial latitudes
indisposed them to yield the vine, gave birth to
other products which served as substitutes; and the
inhabitants rivalled or surpassed those of the south
in all kinds of Bacchanalian indulgence—the pleasures
of drinking constituting one of the most fertile
themes of their poetry, in the same manner as,
in other climates, they gave inspiration to the souls
of Anacreon and Hafiz.</p>

<p>Drunkenness has varied greatly at different times
and among different nations. There can be no doubt
that it prevails more in a rude than in a civilized
state of society. This is so much the case, that as
men get more refined, the vice will gradually be
found to soften down, and assume a less revolting
character. Nor can there be a doubt that it prevails
to a much greater extent in northern than in
southern latitudes.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The nature of the climate
renders this inevitable, and gives to the human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
frame its capabilities of withstanding liquor: hence,
a quantity which scarcely ruffles the frozen current
of a Norwegian’s blood, would scatter madness and
fever into the brain of the Hindoo. Even in Europe,
the inhabitants of the south are far less adapted to
sustain intoxicating agents than those of the north.
Much of this depends upon the coldness of the climate,
and much also upon the peculiar physical and
moral frame to which that coldness gives rise. The
natives of the south are a lively, versatile people;
sanguine in their temperaments, and susceptible, to
an extraordinary degree, of every impression. Their
minds seem to inherit the brilliancy of their climate,
and are rich with sparkling thoughts and beautiful
imagery. The northern nations are the reverse of
all this. With more intensity of purpose, with
greater depth of reasoning powers, and superior
solidity of judgment, they are in a great measure
destitute of that sportive and creative brilliancy
which hangs like a rainbow over the spirits of the
south, and clothes them in a perpetual sunshine of
delight. The one is chiefly led by the heart, the
other by the head. The one possesses the beauty of
a flower-garden, the other the sternness of the rock,
mixed with its severe and naked hardihood. Upon
constitutions so differently organized, it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
expected that a given portion of stimulus will operate
with equal power. The airy inflammable nature of
the first, is easily roused to excitation, and manifests
feelings which the second does not experience till he
has partaken much more largely of the stimulating
cause. On this account, the one may be inebriated,
and the other remain comparatively sober upon a
similar quantity. In speaking of this subject, it is
always to be remembered that a person is not to be
considered a drunkard because he consumes a certain
portion of liquor; but because what he does consume
produces certain effects upon his system. The
Russian, therefore, may take six glasses a-day, and
be as temperate as the Italian who takes four, or
the Indian who takes two. But even when this is
acceded to, the balance of sobriety will be found in
favour of the south: the inhabitants there not only
drink less, but are, <i>bonâ fide</i>, more seldom intoxicated
than the others. Those who have contrasted
London and Paris, may easily verify this fact; and
those who have done the same to the cities of Moscow
and Rome, can bear still stronger testimony.
Who ever heard of an Englishman sipping <i>eau sucrée</i>,
and treating his friends to a glass of lemonade?
Yet such things are common in France; and, of all
the practices of that country, they are those most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
thoroughly visited by the contemptuous malisons
of John Bull.</p>

<p>It is a common belief that wine was the only
inebriating liquor known to antiquity; but this is
a mistake. Tacitus mentions the use of ale or beer
as common among the Germans of his time. By the
Egyptians, likewise, whose country was ill adapted
to the cultivation of the grape, it was employed as
a substitute for wine. Ale was common in the middle
ages; and Mr. Park states that very good beer
is made, by the usual process of brewing and malting,
in the interior of Africa. The favourite drink
of our Saxon ancestors was ale or mead. Those
worshippers of Odin were so notoriously addicted
to drunkenness, that it was regarded as honourable
rather than otherwise; and the man who could withstand
the greatest quantity was looked upon with
admiration and respect: whence the drunken songs
of the Scandinavian scalds; whence the glories of
Valhalla, the fancied happiness of whose inhabitants
consisted in quaffing draughts from the skulls of their
enemies slain in battle. Even ardent spirit, which
is generally supposed to be a modern discovery,
existed from a very early period. It is said to have
been first made by the Arabians in the middle ages,
and in all likelihood may lay claim to a still remoter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
origin. Alcohol was known to the alchymists as
early as the middle of the twelfth century, although
the process of preparing it was by them, at that time,
kept a profound secret. The spirituous liquor called
arrack has been manufactured in the island of Java,
as well as in the continent of Hindostan, from time
immemorial. Brandy appears to have been known
to Galen, who recommends it for the cure of voracious
appetite;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and its distillation was common in
Sicily at the commencement of the fourteenth century.
As to wine, it was so common in ancient
times as to have a tutelar god appropriated to it:
Bacchus and his companion Silenus are as household
words in the mouths of all, and constituted most
important features of the heathen mythology. We
have all heard of the Falernian and Campanian
wines, and of the wines of Cyprus and Shiraz.
Indeed, there is reason to believe that the ancients
were in no respect inferior to the moderns in the
excellence of their vinous liquors, whatever they
may have been in the variety. Wine was so common
in the eastern nations, that Mahomet, foreseeing
the baleful effects of its propagation, forbade it to
his followers, who, to compensate themselves, had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
recourse to opium. The Gothic or dark ages seem
to have been those in which it was least common:
in proof of this it may be mentioned, that in 1298 it
was vended as a cordial by the English apothecaries.
At the present day it is little drunk, except by the
upper classes, in those countries which do not naturally
furnish the grape. In those that do, it is so cheap
as to come within the reach of even the lowest.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In speaking of drunkenness, it is impossible not to
be struck with the physical and moral degradation
which it has spread over the world. Wherever intoxicating
liquors become general, morality has been
found on the decline. They seem to act like the
simoom of the desert, and scatter destruction and
misery around their path. The ruin of Rome was
owing to luxury, of which indulgence in wine was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the principal ingredient. Hannibal’s army fell less
by the arms of Scipio than by the wines of Capua;
and the inebriated hero of Macedon, after slaying
his friend Clytus, and burning the palace of Persepolis,
expired at last of a fit of intoxication, in his
thirty-third year. A volume might be written in
illustration of the evil effects of dissipation; but
this is unnecessary to those who look carefully
around them, and more especially to those who are
conversant with the history of mankind. At the
same time, when we speak of drunkenness as
occurring in antiquity, it is proper to remark, that
there were certain countries in which it was viewed
in a much more dishonourable light than by any
modern nation. The Nervii refused to drink wine,
alleging that it made them cowardly and effeminate:
these simple people had no idea of what by our
seamen is called <i>Dutch courage</i>; they did not feel
the necessity of elevating their native valour by an
artificial excitement. The ancient Spartans held
ebriety in such abhorrence, that, with a view to
inspire the rising generation with a due contempt
of the vice, it was customary to intoxicate the slaves
and exhibit them publicly in this degraded condition.
By the Indians, drunkenness is looked upon
as a species of insanity; and, in their language, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
word <i>ramgam</i>, signifying a drunkard, signifies
also a madman. Both the ancients and moderns
could jest as well as moralize upon this subject.
“There hangs a bottle of wine,” was the derisive
exclamation of the Roman soldiery, as they pointed
to the body of the drunken Bonosus, who, in a fit
of despair, suspended himself upon a tree. “If you
wish to have a shoe of durable materials,” exclaims
the facetious Matthew Langsberg, “you should
make the upper leather of the mouth of a hard
drinker—for that never lets in water.”</p>

<p>If we turn from antiquity to our own times, we
shall find little cause to congratulate ourselves
upon any improvement. The vice has certainly
diminished among the higher orders of society, but
there is every reason to fear that, of late, it has
made fearful strides among the lower. Thirty or
forty years ago, a landlord did not conceive he
had done justice to his guests unless he sent them
from his table in a state of intoxication. This
practice still prevails pretty generally in Ireland
and in the Highlands of Scotland, but in other
parts of the kingdom it is fast giving way: and it
is to be hoped that the day is not far distant when
greater temperance will extend to these jovial
districts, and render their hospitality a little more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
consonant with prudence and moderation. The
increase of drunkenness among the lower classes
may be imputed to various causes, and chiefly to
the late abandonment of part of the duty on rum and
whisky. This was done with a double motive of
benefiting agriculture and commerce, and of driving
the “giant smuggler” from the field. The latter
object it has in a great measure failed of effecting.
The smuggler still plies his trade to a considerable
extent, and brings his commodity to the market
with nearly the same certainty of acquiring profit
as ever. It would be well if the liquor vended to
the poor possessed the qualities of that furnished
by the contraband dealer; but, instead of this, it is
usually a vile compound of every thing spurious
and pestilent, and seems expressly contrived for
the purpose of preying upon the vitals of the unfortunate
victims who partake of it. The extent
to which adulteration has been carried in all kinds
of liquor, is indeed such as to interest every class
of society. Wine, for instance, is often impregnated
with alum and sugar of lead, the latter
dangerous ingredient being resorted to by innkeepers
and others, to take away the sour taste so
common in bad wines. Even the colour of these
liquids is frequently artificial; and the deep rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
complexion so greatly admired by persons not in
the secrets of the trade, is often caused, or at least
heightened, by factitious additions, such as elderberries,
bilberries, red-woods, &amp;c. Alum and sugar
of lead are also common in spirituous liquors; and,
in many cases, oil of vitriol, turpentine, and other
materials equally abominable, are to be found in
combination with them. That detestable liquor
called British gin, is literally compounded of these
ingredients: nor are malt liquors, with their multifarious
narcotic additions, less thoroughly sophisticated
or less detrimental to the health. From
these circumstances, two conclusions must naturally
be drawn; <i>viz.</i>, that inebriating agents often contain
elements of disease foreign to themselves; and that
all persons purchasing them should endeavour to
ascertain the state of their purity, and employ no
dealer whose honour and honesty are not known to
be unimpeachable. Liquors, even in their purest
state, are too often injurious to the constitution
without the admixture of poisons.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The varieties of wine are so numerous as almost
to defy calculation. Mr. Brande, in his table,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
gives a list of no less than forty-four different kinds;
and there are others which he has not enumerated.
Ardent spirits are fewer in number, and may be
mostly comprised under the heads of rum, gin,
brandy, and whisky. The first is the prevailing
drink over the West Indies, North America, and
such cities of Great Britain as are intimately
connected with these regions by commerce. The
second is extensively used in Holland and Switzerland,
the countries which principally furnish it,
and has found its way pretty generally over the
whole of Europe. The third is chiefly produced
in Charente and Languedoc, and is the spirit most
commonly found in the south. The fourth is confined
in a great measure to Ireland and Scotland,
in which latter country the best has always been
made. Of malt liquors we have many varieties.
Britain, especially England, is the country which
furnishes them in greatest perfection. They are
the natural drinks of Englishmen—the <i>vinum Anglicorum</i>,
as foreigners have often remarked. Every
town of any consequence in the empire has its
Brewery; and in almost every one is there some
difference in the quality of the liquor. Brown
stout, London and Scotch porters, Burton, Dorchester,
Edinburgh, and Alloa ales, are only a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of the endless varieties of these widely-circulated
fluids.</p>

<p>Besides wines, ardent spirits, and malt liquors,
there are many other agents possessing inebriating
properties. Among others, the <i>Peganum Harmala</i>
or Syrian rue, so often used by the sultan Solyman;
the <i>Hibiscus Saldarissa</i>, which furnishes the Indian
bangue, and from which the <i>Nepenthes</i> of the
ancients is supposed to have been made; the
<i>Balsac</i>, or Turkish bangue, found on the shores of
the Levant; the <i>Penang</i>, or Indian betel; the
<i>Hyoscyamus Niger</i>; and the <i>Atropa Belladonna</i>.
In addition to these, and many more, there are
opium, tobacco, <i>Cocculus Indicus</i>, and the innumerable
tribes of liqueurs and ethers, together with
other agents of a less potent nature, such as clary,
darnel, and saffron. The variety of agents capable
of exciting drunkenness is indeed surprising, and
in proportion to their number seems the prevalence
of that fatal vice to which an improper use of them
gives rise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="smaller">CAUSES OF DRUNKENNESS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The causes of drunkenness are so obvious, that few
authors have thought it necessary to point them out:
we shall merely say a few words upon the subject.
There are some persons who will never be drunkards,
and others who will be so in spite of all that
can be done to prevent them. Some are drunkards
by choice, and others by necessity. The former have
an innate and constitutional fondness for liquor, and
drink <i>con amore</i>. Such men are usually of a sanguineous
temperament, of coarse unintellectual minds,
and of low and animal propensities. They have, in
general, a certain rigidity of fibre, and a flow of animal
spirits which other people are without. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
delight in the roar and riot of drinking clubs; and
with them, in particular, all the miseries of life may
be referred to the bottle.</p>

<p>The drunkard by necessity was never meant by
nature to be dissipated. He is perhaps a person of
amiable dispositions, whom misfortune has overtaken,
and who, instead of bearing up manfully against it,
endeavours to drown his sorrows in liquor. It is an
excess of sensibility, a partial mental weakness, an
absolute misery of the heart, which drives him on.
Drunkenness, with him, is a consequence of misfortune;
it is a solitary dissipation preying upon him
in silence. Such a man frequently dies broken-hearted,
even before his excesses have had time to
destroy him by their own unassisted agency.</p>

<p>Some become drunkards from excess of indulgence
in youth. There are parents who have a common
custom of treating their children to wine, punch, and
other intoxicating liquors. This, in reality, is regularly
bringing them up in an apprenticeship to drunkenness.
Others are taught the vice by frequenting
drinking clubs and masonic lodges. These are the
genuine academies of tippling. Two-thirds of the
drunkards we meet with, have been there initiated
in that love of intemperance and boisterous irregularity
which distinguish their future lives. Men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
who are good singers are very apt to become drunkards,
and, in truth, most of them are so, more or
less, especially if they have naturally much joviality
or warmth of temperament. A fine voice to such
men is a fatal accomplishment.</p>

<p>Ebriety prevails to an alarming degree among the
lower orders of society. It exists more in towns
than in the country, and more among mechanics than
husbandmen. Most of the misery to be observed
among the working classes springs from this source.
No persons are more addicted to the habit, and all
its attendant vices, than the pampered servants of
the great. Innkeepers, musicians, actors, and men
who lead a rambling and eccentric life, are exposed
to a similar hazard. Husbands sometimes teach
their wives to be drunkards by indulging them in
toddy, and such fluids, every time they themselves
sit down to their libations.</p>

<p>Women frequently acquire the vice by drinking
porter and ale while nursing. These stimulants
are usually recommended to them, from well-meant
but mistaken motives, by their female attendants.
Many fine young women are ruined by this pernicious
practice. Their persons become gross, their
milk unhealthy, and a foundation is too often laid
for future indulgence in liquor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The frequent use of cordials, such as noyau, shrub,
kirsch-wasser, curaçoa, and anissette, sometimes
leads to the practice. The active principle of these
liqueurs is neither more nor less than ardent spirits.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Among other causes, may be mentioned the
excessive use of spirituous tinctures for the cure of
hypochondria and indigestion. Persons who use
strong tea, especially green, run the same risk. The
latter species is singularly hurtful to the constitution,
producing hysteria, heartburn, and general debility
of the chylopoetic viscera. Some of these bad effects
are relieved for a time by the use of spirits; and
what was at first employed as a medicine, soon becomes
an essential requisite.</p>

<p>Certain occupations have a tendency to induce
drunkenness. Innkeepers, recruiting-sergeants,
pugilists, &amp;c., are all exposed in a great degree to
temptation in this respect; and intemperance is a
vice which may be very often justly charged against
them. Commercial travellers, also, taken as a body,
are open to the accusation of indulging too freely in
the bottle, although I am not aware that they carry
it to such excess as to entitle many of them to be
ranked as drunkards. “Well fed, riding from town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
to town, and walking to the houses of the several
tradesmen, they have an employment not only more
agreeable, but more conducive to health than almost
any other dependant on traffic. But they destroy
their constitutions by intemperance; not generally
by drunkenness, but by taking more liquor than
nature requires. Dining at the traveller’s table,
each drinks his pint or bottle of wine; he then takes
negus or spirit with several of his customers; and
at night he must have a glass or two of brandy and
water. Few commercial travellers bear the employ
for thirty years—the majority not twenty.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Some writers allege that unmarried women, especially
if somewhat advanced in life, are more given
to liquor than those who are married. This point
I am unable from my own observation to decide.
Women who indulge in this way, are <i>solitary</i> dram-drinkers,
and so would men be, had not the arbitrary
opinions of the world invested the practice in
them with much less moral turpitude than in the
opposite sex. Of the two sexes, there can be no
doubt that men are much the more addicted to all
sorts of intemperance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Drunkenness appears to be in some measure
hereditary. We frequently see it descending from
parents to their children. This may undoubtedly
often arise from bad example and imitation, but
there can be little question that, in many instances
at least, it exists as a family predisposition.</p>

<p>Men of genius are often unfortunately addicted
to drinking. Nature, as she has gifted them with
greater powers than their fellows, seems also to
have mingled with their cup of life more bitterness.
There is a melancholy which is apt to come like a
cloud over the imaginations of such characters.
Their minds possess a susceptibility and a delicacy
of structure which unfit them for the gross atmosphere
of human nature; wherefore, high talent has
ever been distinguished for sadness and gloom.
Genius lives in a world of its own: it is the essence
of a superior nature—the loftier imaginings of the
mind, clothed with a more spiritual and refined verdure.
Few men endowed with such faculties enjoy
the ordinary happiness of humanity. The stream
of their lives runs harsh and broken. Melancholy
thoughts sweep perpetually across their souls; and
if these be heightened by misfortune, they are
plunged into the deepest misery.</p>

<p>To relieve these feelings, many plans have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
adopted. Dr. Johnson fled for years to wine under
his habitual gloom. He found that the pangs were
removed while its immediate influence lasted, but
he also found that they returned with double force
when that influence passed away. He saw the dangerous
precipice on which he stood, and, by an unusual
effort of volition, gave it over. In its stead
he substituted tea; and to this milder stimulus had
recourse in his melancholy. Voltaire and Fontenelle,
for the same purpose, used coffee. The
excitements of Newton and Hobbes were the fumes
of tobacco, while Demosthenes and Haller were
sufficiently stimulated by drinking freely of cold
water. Such are the differences of constitution.</p>

<p>“As good be melancholy still, as drunken beasts
and beggars.” So says old Burton, in his Anatomy
of Melancholy, and there are few who will not
subscribe to his creed. The same author quaintly,
but justly, remarks, “If a drunken man gets a child,
it will never, likely, have a good brain.” Dr.
Darwin, a great authority on all subjects connected
with life, says, that he never knew a glutton affected
with the gout, who was not at the same time addicted
to liquor. He also observes, “it is remarkable
that all the diseases from drinking spirituous
or fermented liquors are liable to become hereditary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
even to the third generation, gradually increasing,
if the cause be continued, till the family becomes
extinct.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We need not endeavour to trace further the
remote causes of drunkenness. A drunkard is
rarely able to recall the particular circumstances
which made him so. The vice creeps upon him
insensibly, and he is involved in its fetters before
he is aware. It is enough that we know the
proximate cause, and also the certain consequences.
One thing is certain, that a man who addicts himself
to intemperance, can never be said to be sound
in mind or body. The former is a state of partial
insanity, while the effects of the liquor remain; and
the latter is always more or less diseased in its
actions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br>
<span class="smaller">PHENOMENA OF DRUNKENNESS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The consequences of drunkenness are dreadful, but
the pleasures of getting drunk are certainly ecstatic.
While the illusion lasts, happiness is complete;
care and melancholy are thrown to the wind; and
Elysium, with all its glories, descends upon the
dazzled imagination of the drinker.</p>

<p>Some authors have spoken of the pleasure of
being completely drunk; this, however, is not the
most exquisite period. The time is when a person is
neither “drunken nor sober, but neighbour to both,”
as Bishop Andrews says in his “Ex—ale—tation of
Ale.” The moment is when the ethereal emanations
begin to float around the brain—when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
soul is commencing to expand its wings and rise
from earth—when the tongue feels itself somewhat
loosened in the mouth, and breaks the previous
taciturnity, if any such existed.</p>

<p>What are the sensations of incipient drunkenness?
First, an unusual serenity prevails over the
mind, and the soul of the votary is filled with a
placid satisfaction. By degrees he is sensible of a
soft and not unmusical humming in his ears, at
every pause of the conversation. He seems, to
himself, to wear his head lighter than usual upon
his shoulders. Then a species of obscurity, thinner
than the finest mist, passes before his eyes, and
makes him see objects rather indistinctly. The
lights begin to dance and appear double. A gaiety
and warmth are felt at the same time about the
heart. The imagination is expanded, and filled
with a thousand delightful images. He becomes
loquacious, and pours forth, in enthusiastic language,
the thoughts which are born, as it were, within him.</p>

<p>Now comes a spirit of universal contentment
with himself and all the world. He thinks no more
of misery: it is dissolved in the bliss of the moment.
This is the acmé of the fit—the ecstasy is
now perfect. As yet the sensorium is in tolerable
order: it is only shaken, but the capability of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
thinking with accuracy still remains. About this
time, the drunkard pours out all the secrets of his
soul. His qualities, good or bad, come forth without
reserve; and now, if at any time, the human
heart may be seen into. In a short period, he is
seized with a most inordinate propensity to talk
nonsense, though he is perfectly conscious of doing
so. He also commits many foolish things, knowing
them to be foolish. The power of volition, that
faculty which keeps the will subordinate to the
judgment, seems totally weakened. The most
delightful time seems to be that immediately before
becoming very talkative. When this takes place,
a man turns ridiculous, and his mirth, though more
boisterous, is not so exquisite. At first the intoxication
partakes of sentiment, but, latterly, it becomes
merely animal.</p>

<p>After this the scene thickens. The drunkard’s
imagination gets disordered with the most grotesque
conceptions. Instead of moderating his drink, he
pours it down more rapidly than ever: glass follows
glass with reckless energy. His head becomes
perfectly giddy. The candles burn blue, or green,
or yellow; and where there are perhaps only three
on the table, he sees a dozen. According to his
temperament, he is amorous, or musical, or quarrelsome.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Many possess a most extraordinary wit;
and a great flow of spirits is a general attendant.
In the latter stages, the speech is thick, and the
use of the tongue in a great measure lost. His
mouth is half open, and idiotic in the expression;
while his eyes are glazed, wavering, and watery.
He is apt to fancy that he has offended some one of
the company, and is ridiculously profuse with his
apologies. Frequently he mistakes one person for
another, and imagines that some of those before
him are individuals who are, in reality, absent or
even dead. The muscular powers are, all along,
much affected: this indeed happens before any
great change takes place in the mind, and goes on
progressively increasing. He can no longer walk
with steadiness, but totters from side to side.
The limbs become powerless, and inadequate to
sustain his weight. He is, however, not always
sensible of any deficiency in this respect: and while
exciting mirth by his eccentric motions, imagines
that he walks with the most perfect steadiness.
In attempting to run, he conceives that he passes
over the ground with astonishing rapidity. To his
distorted eyes all men, and even inanimate nature
itself, seem to be drunken, while he alone is sober.
Houses reel from side to side as if they had lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
their balance; trees and steeples nod like tipsy
Bacchanals; and the very earth seems to slip from
under his feet, and leave him walking and floundering
upon the air. The last stage of drunkenness
is total insensibility. The man tumbles perhaps
beneath the table, and is carried away in a state of
stupor to his couch. In this condition he is said
to be <i>dead drunk</i>.</p>

<p>When the drunkard is put to bed, let us suppose
that his faculties are not totally absorbed in apoplectic
stupor; let us suppose that he still possesses
consciousness and feeling, though these are both
disordered; then begins “the tug of war;” then
comes the misery which is doomed to succeed his
previous raptures. No sooner is his head laid upon
the pillow, than it is seized with the strongest
throbbing. His heart beats quick and hard against
the ribs. A noise like the distant fall of a cascade,
or rushing of a river, is heard in his ears: sough—sough—sough,
goes the sound. His senses now
become more drowned and stupified. A dim
recollection of his carousals, like a shadowy and
indistinct dream, passes before the mind. He still
hears, as in echo, the cries and laughter of his
companions. Wild fantastic fancies accumulate
thickly around the brain. His giddiness is greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
than ever; and he feels as if in a ship tossed upon
a heaving sea. At last he drops insensibly into a
profound slumber.</p>

<p>In the morning he awakes in a high fever. The
whole body is parched; the palms of the hands,
in particular, are like leather. His head is often
violently painful. He feels excessive thirst; while
his tongue is white, dry, and stiff. The whole
inside of the mouth is likewise hot and constricted,
and the throat often sore. Then look at his eyes—how
sickly, dull, and languid! The fire, which
first lighted them up the evening before, is all gone.
A stupor like that of the last stage of drunkenness
still clings about them, and they are disagreeably
affected by the light. The complexion sustains as
great a change: it is no longer flushed with the
gaiety and excitation, but pale and wayworn, indicating
a profound mental and bodily exhaustion.
There is probably sickness, and the appetite is totally
gone. Even yet the delirium of intoxication has
not left him, for his head still rings, his heart still
throbs violently; and if he attempt getting up,
he stumbles with giddiness. The mind also is sadly
depressed, and the proceedings of the previous
night are painfully remembered. He is sorry for
his conduct, promises solemnly never again so to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
commit himself, and calls impatiently for something
to quench his thirst. Such are the usual phenomena
of a fit of drunkenness.</p>

<p>In the beginning of intoxication we are inclined
to sleep, especially if we indulge alone. In companies,
the noise and opportunity of conversing
prevent this; and when a certain quantity has
been drunk, the drowsy tendency wears away. A
person who wishes to stand out well, should never
talk much. This increases the effects of the liquor,
and hurries on intoxication. Hence, every experienced
drunkard holds it to be a piece of prudence
to keep his tongue under restraint.</p>

<p>The giddiness of intoxication is always greater
in darkness than in the light. I know of no rational
way in which this can be explained; but, certain it is,
the drunkard never so well knows his true condition
as when alone and in darkness. Possibly the noise
and light distracted the mind, and made the bodily
sensations be, for the time, in some measure unfelt.</p>

<p>There are some persons who get sick from
drinking even a small quantity; and this sickness
is, upon the whole, a favourable circumstance, as it
proves an effectual curb upon them, however much
they may be disposed to intemperance. In such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
cases, it will generally be found that the sickness
takes place as soon as vertigo makes its appearance:
it seems, in reality, to be produced by this sensation.
This, however, is a rare circumstance, for
though vertigo from ordinary causes has a strong
tendency to produce sickness, that arising from
drunkenness has seldom this effect. The nausea and
sickness sometimes occurring in intoxication, proceed
almost always from the surcharged and disordered
state of the stomach, and very seldom from the
accompanying giddiness.</p>

<p>Intoxication, before it proceeds too far, has a
powerful tendency to increase the appetite. Perhaps
it would be more correct to say, that inebriating
liquors, by stimulating the stomach, have this
power. We often see gluttony and drunkenness
combined together at the same time. This continues
till the last stage, when, from overloading
and excess of irritation, the stomach expels its
contents by vomiting.</p>

<p>All along, the action of the kidneys is much
increased, especially at the commencement of intoxication.
When a large quantity of intoxicating
fluid has been suddenly taken into the stomach, the
usual preliminary symptoms of drunkenness do not
appear. An instantaneous stupefaction ensues;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and the person is at once knocked down. This cannot
be imputed to distention of the cerebral vessels,
but to a sudden operation on the nervous branches
of the stomach. The brain is thrown into a state
of collapse, and many of its functions suspended.
In such cases, the face is not at first tumid and
ruddy, but pale and contracted. The pulse is
likewise feeble, and the body cold and powerless.
When re-action takes place, these symptoms wear
off, and those of sanguineous apoplexy succeed;
such as turgid countenance, full but slow pulse, and
strong stertorous breathing. The vessels of the
brain have now become filled, and there is a strong
determination to that organ.</p>

<p>Persons of tender or compassionate minds are particularly
subject, during intoxication, to be affected
to tears at the sight of any distressing object, or
even on hearing an affecting tale. Drunkenness
in such characters, may be said to melt the heart,
and open up the fountains of sorrow. Their sympathy
is often ridiculous, and aroused by the most
trifling causes. Those who have a living imagination,
combined with this tenderness of heart, sometimes
conceive fictitious causes of distress, and
weep bitterly at the wo of their own creating.</p>

<p>There are some persons in whom drunkenness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
calls forth a spirit of piety, or rather of religious
hypocrisy, which is both ludicrous and disgusting.
They become sentimental over their cups; and,
while in a state of debasement most offensive to
God and man, they will weep at the wickedness of
the human heart, entreat you to eschew swearing
and profane company, and have a greater regard
for the welfare of your immortal soul. These
sanctimonious drunkards seem to consider ebriety
as the most venial of offences.</p>

<p>During a paroxysm of drunkenness, the body is
much less sensible to external stimuli than at other
times: it is particularly capable of resisting cold.
Seamen, when absent on shore, are prone to get
intoxicated; and they will frequently lie for hours
on the highway, even in the depth of winter without
any bad consequences. A drunk man seldom
shivers from cold. His frame seems steeled against
it, and he holds out with an apathy which is astonishing.
The body is, in like manner, insensible to
injuries, such as cuts, bruises, &amp;c. He frequently
receives, in fighting, the most severe blows, without
seemingly feeling them, and without, in fact, being
aware of the matter till sobered. Persons in intoxication
have been known to chop off their fingers,
and otherwise disfigure themselves, laughing all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the while at the action. But when the paroxysm
is off, and the frame weakened, things are changed.
External agents are then withstood with little
vigour, with even less than in the natural state of
the body. The person shivers on the slightest chill,
and is more than usually subject to fevers and all
sorts of contagion.</p>

<p>External stimuli frequently break the fit. Men
have been instantly sobered by having a bucket of
cold water thrown upon them, or by falling into a
stream. Strong emotions of the mind produce the
same effect, such as the sense of danger, or a piece
of good or bad news, suddenly communicated.</p>

<p>There are particular situations and circumstances
in which a man can stand liquor better than in
others. In the close atmosphere of a large town,
he is soon overpowered; and it is here that the
genuine drunkard is to be met with in the greatest
perfection. In the country, especially in a mountainous
district, or on the sea-shore, where the air
is cold and piercing, a great quantity may be taken
with impunity. The highlanders drink largely of
ardent spirits, and they are often intoxicated,
yet, among them, there are comparatively few who
can be called habitual drunkards. A keen air
seems to deaden its effects, and it soon evaporates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
from their constitutions. Sailors and soldiers who
are hard wrought, also consume enormous quantities
without injury: porters and all sorts of labourers
do the same. With these men exercise is a corrective;
but in towns, where no counteracting agency
is employed, it acts with irresistible power upon the
frame, and soon proves destructive.</p>

<p>A great quantity of liquors may also be taken
without inebriating, in certain diseases, such as
spasm, tetanus, gangrene, and retrocedent gout.</p>

<p>Certain circumstances of constitution make one
person naturally more apt to get intoxicated than
another. “Mr. Pitt,” says a modern writer,
“would retire in the midst of a warm debate, and
enliven his faculties with a couple of bottles of
Port. Pitt’s constitution enabled him to do this
with impunity. He was afflicted with what is
called a coldness of stomach; and the quantity of
wine that would have closed the oratory of so professed
a Bacchanalian as Sheridan, scarcely excited
the son of Chatham.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>All kinds of intoxicating agents act much more
rapidly and powerfully upon an empty than upon a
full stomach. In like manner, when the stomach
is disordered, and subject to weakness, heartburn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
or disease of any kind, ebriety is more rapidly
produced than when this organ is sound and healthy.</p>

<p>The stomach may get accustomed to a strong
stimulus, and resist it powerfully, while it yields
to one much weaker. I have known people who
could drink eight or ten glasses of raw spirits at a
sitting without feeling them much, become perfectly
intoxicated by half the quantity made into toddy.
In like manner, he who is in the constant habit of
using one spirit—rum, for instance—cannot, for the
most part, indulge to an equal extent in another, without
experiencing more severe effects than if he had
partaken of his usual beverage. This happens even
when the strength of the two liquors is the same.</p>

<p>The mind exercises a considerable effect upon
drunkenness, and may often control it powerfully.
When in the company of a superior whom we
respect, or of a female in whose presence it would
be indelicate to get intoxicated, a much greater
portion of liquor may be withstood than in societies
where no such restraints operate.</p>

<p>Drunkenness has sometimes a curious effect upon
the memory. Actions committed during intoxication
may be forgotten on a recovery from this state,
and remembered distinctly when the person becomes
again intoxicated. Drunkenness has thus an analogy
to dreaming, in which state circumstances are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
occasionally brought to mind which had entirely been
forgotten. The same thing may also occur in fevers,
wherein even languages with which we were familiar
in childhood or youth, but had forgotten, are renewed
upon the memory and pass away from it again
when the disease which recalled them is removed.</p>

<p>With most people intoxication is a gradual process,
and increases progressively as they pour down the
liquor; but there are some individuals in whom it
takes place suddenly, and without any previous indication
of its approach. It is not uncommon to see
such persons sit for hours at the bottle without
experiencing any thing beyond a moderate elevation
of spirits, yet assume all at once the outrage and boisterous
irregularity of the most decided drunkenness.</p>

<p>Some drunkards retain their senses after the physical
powers are quite exhausted. Others, even
when the mind is wrought to a pitch leading to the
most absurd actions, preserve a degree of cunning
and observation which enables them to elude the
tricks which their companions are preparing to play
upon them. In such cases, they display great address,
and take the first opportunity of retaliating;
or, if such does not occur, of slipping out of the
room unobserved and getting away. Some, while the
whole mind seems locked up in the stupor of forgetfulness,
hear all that is going on. No one should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
ever presume on the intoxicated state of another to
talk of him detractingly in his presence. While apparently
deprived of all sensation, he may be an attentive
listener; and whatever is said, though unheeded
at the moment, is not forgotten afterwards, but treasured
carefully up in the memory. Much discord
and ill-will frequently arise from such imprudence.</p>

<p>There are persons who are exceedingly profuse,
and fond of giving away their money, watches, rings,
&amp;c., to the company. This peculiarity will never, I
believe, be found in a miser: avarice is a passion
strong under every circumstance. Drinking does
not loosen the grasp of the covetous man, or open
his heart: he is for ever the same.</p>

<p>The generality of people are apt to talk of their
private affairs when intoxicated. They then reveal
the most deeply-hidden secrets to their companions.
Others have their minds so happily constituted that
nothing escapes them. They are, even in their most
unguarded moments, secret and close as the grave.</p>

<p>The natural disposition may be better discovered
in drunkenness than at any other time. In modern
society, life is all a disguise. Almost every man
walks in masquerade, and his most intimate friend
very often does not know his real character. Many
wear smiles constantly upon their cheeks, whose
hearts are unprincipled and treacherous. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
with violent tempers have all the external calm and
softness of charity itself. Some speak always with
sympathy, who, at soul, are full of gall and bitterness.
Intoxication tears off the veil, and sets each
in his true light, whatever that may be. The combative
man will quarrel, the amorous will love, the
detractor will abuse his neighbour. I have known
exceptions, but they are few in number. At one
time they seemed more numerous, but closer observation
convinced me that most of those whom I
thought drunkenness had libelled, inherited, at bottom,
the genuine dispositions which it brought forth.
The exceptions, however, which now and then occur
are sufficiently striking, and point out the injustice
of always judging of a man’s real disposition from
his drunken moments. To use the words of Addison,
“Not only does this vice betray the hidden
faults of a man, and show them in the most odious
colours, but often occasions faults to which he is
not naturally subject. Wine throws a man out of
himself, and infuses qualities into the mind which
she is a stranger to in her sober moments.” The
well known maxim, “<i>in vino veritas</i>,” therefore,
though very generally true, is to be received with
some restrictions, although these, I am satisfied, are
not by any means so numerous as many authors
would have us to believe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="smaller">DRUNKENNESS MODIFIED BY TEMPERAMENT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Under the last head I have described the usual
phenomena of intoxication; but it is necessary to
remark, that these are apt to be modified by the
physical and moral frame of the drinker. Great
diversity of opinion exists with regard to the doctrine
of the temperaments; some authors affirming,
and others denying their existence. Into this controversy
it is needless to enter. All I contend for is,
that the bodily and mental constitution of every man
is not alike, and that on these peculiarities depend
certain differences during a paroxysm of drunkenness.</p>

<p class="section">I. <i>Sanguineous Drunkard.</i>—The sanguine temperament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
seems to feel most intensely the excitement
of the bottle. Persons of this stamp have
usually a ruddy complexion, thick neck, small head,
and strong muscular fibre. Their intellect is in
general <i>mediocre</i>, for great bodily strength and corresponding
mental powers are rarely united together.
In such people, the animal propensities
prevail over the moral and intellectual ones. They
are prone to combativeness and sensuality, and are
either very good-natured or extremely quarrelsome.
All their passions are keen: like the Irish women,
they will fight for their friends or with them as occasion
requires. They are talkative from the beginning,
and, during confirmed intoxication, perfectly obstreperous.
It is men of this class who are the heroes
of all drunken companies, the patrons of masonic
lodges, the presidents and getters-up of jovial meetings.
With them, eating and drinking are the
grand ends of human life. Look at their eyes, how
they sparkle at the sight of wine, and how their
lips smack and their teeth water in the neighbourhood
of a good dinner: they would scent out a banquet
in Siberia. When intoxicated, their passions
are highly excited: the energies of a hundred minds
then seem concentrated into one focus. Their mirth,
their anger, their love, their folly, are all equally intense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and unquenchable. Such men cannot conceal
their feelings. In drunkenness, the veil is removed
from them, and their characters stand revealed, as
in a glass, to the eye of the beholder. The Roderick
Random of Smollett had much of this temperament,
blended, however, with more intellect
than usually belongs to it.</p>

<p class="section">II. <i>Melancholy Drunkard.</i>—Melancholy, in drunkards,
sometimes arises from temperament, but more
frequently from habitual intoxication or misfortune.
Some men are melancholy by nature, but become
highly mirthful when they have drunk a considerable
quantity. Men of this tone of mind seem to
enjoy the bottle more exquisitely than even the
sanguineous class. The joyousness which it excites
breaks in upon their gloom like sunshine upon darkness.
Above all, the sensations, at the moment
when mirth begins with its magic to charm away
care, are inexpressible. Pleasure falls in showers
of fragrance upon their souls; they are at peace with
themselves and all mankind, and enjoy, as it were,
a foretaste of paradise. Robert Burns was an
example of this variety. His melancholy was constitutional,
but heightened by misfortune. The
bottle commonly dispelled it, and gave rise to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
most delightful images; sometimes, however, it
only aggravated the gloom.</p>

<p class="section">III. <i>Surly Drunkard.</i>—Some men are not excited
to mirth by intoxication: on the contrary, it renders
them gloomy and discontented. Even those who in
the sober state are sufficiently gay, become occasionally
thus altered. A great propensity to take
offence is a characteristic among persons of this
temperament. They are suspicious, and very often
mischievous. If at some former period they have
had a difference with any of the company, they are
sure to revive it, although, probably, it has been
long ago cemented on both sides, and even forgotten
by the other party. People of this description
are very unpleasant companions. They are in
general so foul-tongued, quarrelsome, and indecent in
conversation, that established clubs of drinkers have
made it a practice to exclude them from their society.</p>

<p class="section">IV. <i>Phlegmatic Drunkard.</i>—Persons of this temperament
are heavy-rolling machines, and, like the
above, are not roused to mirth by liquor. Their
vital actions are dull and spiritless—the blood in
their veins as sluggish as the river Jordan, and
their energies stagnant as the Dead Sea. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
are altogether a negative sort of beings, with passions
too inert to lead them to any thing very good
or very bad. They are a species of animated clods,
but not thoroughly animated—for the vital fire of
feeling has got cooled in penetrating their frozen
frames. A new Prometheus would require to
breathe into their nostrils, to give them the ordinary
glow and warmth of humanity. Look at a
phlegmatic man—how dead, passionless, and uninspired
is the expression of his clammy lips and
vacant eye! Speak to him—how cold, slow, and
tame is his conversation! the words come forth as
if they were drawn from his mouth with a pair of
pincers; and the ideas are as frozen as if concocted
in the bowels of Lapland. Liquor produces no
effect upon his mental powers; or, if it does, it is a
smothering one. The whole energies of the drink
fall on his almost impassive frame. From the first,
his drunkenness is stupifying; he is seized with a
kind of lethargy, the white of his eyes turns up, he
breathes loud and harshly, and sinks into an apoplectic
stupor. Yet all this is perfectly harmless,
and wears away without leaving any mark behind it.</p>

<p>Such persons are very apt to be played upon
by their companions. There are few men who, in
their younger days have not assisted in shaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the heads and painting the faces of these lethargic
drunkards.</p>

<p class="section">V. <i>Nervous Drunkard.</i>—This is a very harmless
and very tiresome personage. Generally of a weak
mind and irritable constitution, he does not become
boisterous with mirth, and rarely shows the least
glimmering of wit or mental energy. He is talkative
and fond of long-winded stories, which he tells
in a drivelling, silly manner. Never warmed into
enthusiasm by liquor, he keeps chatting at some
ridiculous tale, very much in the way of a garrulous
old man in his dotage.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class="section">VI. <i>Choleric Drunkard.</i>—There are a variety of
drunkards whom I can only class under the above
title. They seem to possess few of the qualities of
the other races, and are chiefly distinguished by an
uncommon testiness of disposition. They are quick,
irritable, and impatient, but withal good at heart,
and, when in humour, very pleasant and generous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
They are easily put out of temper, but it returns
almost immediately. This disposition is very prevalent
among Welshmen and Highland lairds.
Mountaineers are usually quick-tempered; but such
men are not the worst or most unpleasant. Sterne
is undoubtedly right when he says that more virtue
is to be found in warm than cold dispositions.
Commodore Trunnion is a marked example of this
temperament; and Captain Fluellen, who compelled
the <i>heroic</i> Pistol to eat the leek, is another.</p>

<p class="section">VII. <i>Periodical Drunkard.</i>—There are persons
whose temperaments are so peculiarly constituted,
that they indulge to excess <i>periodically</i>, and are, in
the intervals of these indulgences, remarkably sober.
This is not a very common case, but I have known
more than one instance of it; and a gentleman, distinguished
by the power of his eloquence in the
senate and at the bar, is said to furnish another.
In the cases which I have known, the drunken
mania, for it can get no other name, came on three
or four times a-year. The persons, from a state of
complete sobriety, felt the most intense desire for
drink; and no power, short of absolute force or confinement
could restrain them from the indulgence.
In every case they seemed to be quite aware of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
uncontrollable nature of their passion, and proceeded
systematically by confining themselves to their room,
and procuring a large quantity of ardent spirits. As
soon as this was done, they commenced and drank
to excess till vomiting ensued, and the stomach
absolutely refused to receive another drop of liquor.
This state may last a few days or a few weeks,
according to constitutional strength, or the rapidity
with which the libations are poured down. During
the continuance of the attack, the individual exhibits
such a state of mind as may be looked for from his
peculiar temperament; he may be sanguineous, or
melancholy, or surly, or phlegmatic, or nervous, or
choleric. So soon as the stomach rejects every
thing that is swallowed, and severe sickness comes
on, the fit ceases. From that moment, recovery
takes place, and his former fondness for liquor is
succeeded by aversion or disgust. This gains such
ascendancy over him, that he abstains religiously
from it for weeks, or months, or even for a year,
as the case may be. During this interval he leads
a life of the most exemplary temperance, drinking
nothing but cold water, and probably shunning
every society where he is likely to be exposed to
indulgence. So soon as this period of sobriety has
expired, the fit again comes on; and he continues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
playing the same game for perhaps the better part
of a long life. This class of persons I would call
periodical drunkards.</p>

<p class="section">These different varieties are sometimes found
strongly marked; at other times so blended together
that it is not easy to say which predominates.
The most agreeable drunkard is he whose
temperament lies between the sanguineous and the
melancholic. The genuine sanguineous is a sad
noisy dog, and so common, that every person must
have met with him. The naval service furnishes a
great many gentlemen of this description. The
phlegmatic, I think, is rarer, but both the nervous
and the surly are not unusual.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="smaller">DRUNKENNESS MODIFIED BY THE INEBRIATING AGENT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Intoxication is not only influenced by temperament,
but by the nature of the agent which produces
it. Thus, ebriety from ardent spirits differs in
some particulars from that brought on by opium or
malt liquors, such as porter and ale.</p>

<p class="section">I. <i>Modified by Ardent Spirits.</i>—Alcohol is the
principle of intoxication in all liquors. It is this
which gives to wine,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> ale, and spirits, their characteristic
properties. In the natural state, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
it is so pungent, that it could not be received into
the stomach, even in a moderate quantity, without
producing death. It can, therefore, only be used
in dilution; and in this state we have it, from the
strongest ardent spirits, to simple small beer. The
first (ardent spirits) being the most concentrated of
its combinations, act most rapidly upon the constitution.
They are more inflammatory, and intoxicate
sooner than any of the others. Swallowed in an
overdose, they act almost instantaneously—extinguishing
the senses and overcoming the whole
body with a sudden stupor. When spirits are
swallowed raw, as in the form of a dram, they excite
a glow of heat in the throat and stomach, succeeded,
in those who are not much accustomed to their
use, by a flushing of the countenance, and a copious
discharge of tears. They are strongly diuretic.</p>

<p>Persons who indulge too much in spirits rarely
get corpulent, unless their indulgence be coupled
with good living. Their bodies become emaciated;
they get spindle-shanked; their eyes are glazed and
hollow; their cheeks fall in; and a premature old
age overtakes them. They do not eat so well as
their brother drunkards. An insatiable desire for
a morning dram makes them early risers, and their
breakfast amounts to almost nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>The principal varieties of spirits, as already mentioned,
are rum, brandy, whisky, and gin. It is
needless to enter into any detail of the history of
these fluids. Brandy kills soonest; it takes most
rapidly to the head, and, more readily than the
others, tinges the face to a crimson or livid hue.
Rum is probably the next in point of fatality; and,
after that, whisky and gin. The superior diuretic
qualities of the two latter, and the less luscious
sources from which they are procured, may possibly
account for such differences. I am, at the
same time, aware that some persons entertain a
different idea of the relative danger of these
liquors: some, for instance, conceive that gin is
more rapidly fatal than any of them; but it is to
be remembered, that it, more than any other ardent
spirit, is liable to adulteration. That, from this
circumstance, more lives may be lost by its use, I
do not deny. In speaking of gin, however, and
comparing its effects with those of the rest of the
class to which it belongs, I must be understood to
speak of it in its pure condition, and not in that
detestable state of sophistication in which such vast
quantities of it are drunk in London and elsewhere.
When pure, I have no hesitation in affirming that
it is decidedly more wholesome than either brandy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
or rum; and that the popular belief of its greater
tendency to produce dropsy, is quite unfounded.</p>

<p>An experiment has lately been made for the
purpose of ascertaining the comparative powers of
gin, brandy, and rum, upon the human body, which
is not less remarkable for the inconsequent conclusions
deduced from it, than for the ignorance it
displays in confounding dead animal matter with
the living fibre. It was made as follows:—</p>

<p>A piece of raw liver was put into a glass of gin,
another into a glass of rum, and a third into a glass
of brandy. That in the gin was, in a given time,
partially decomposed; that in the rum, in the same
time, not diminished; and that in the brandy quite
dissolved. It was concluded from these results, that
rum was the most wholesome spirit of the three,
and brandy the least. The inferences deduced
from these premises are not only erroneous, but
glaringly absurd; the premises would even afford
grounds for drawing results of the very opposite
nature: it might be said, for instance, that though
brandy be capable of dissolving dead animal matter,
there is no evidence that it can do the same to the
living stomach, and that it would in reality prove
less hurtful than the others, in so far as it would,
more effectually than they, dissolve the food contained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
in that organ. These experiments, in fact,
prove nothing; and could only have been suggested
by one completely ignorant of the functions of the
animal economy. There is a power inherent in
the vital principle which resists the laws that
operate upon dead matter. This is known to
every practitioner, and is the reason why the most
plausible and recondite speculations of chemistry
have come to naught in their trials upon the living
frame. The only way to judge of the respective
effects of ardent spirits, is by experience and physiological
reasoning, both of which inform us that
the spirit most powerfully diuretic must rank highest
in the scale of safety. Now and then persons
are met with on whose frames both gin and whisky
have a much more heating effect than the two
other varieties of spirits. This, however, is not
common, and when it does occur, can only be
referred to some unaccountable idiosyncrasy of
constitution.</p>

<p class="section">II. <i>Modified by Wines.</i>—Drunkenness from wines
closely resembles that from ardent spirits. It is
equally airy and volatile, more especially if the
light wines, such as Champaign, Claret, Chambertin,
or Volnay, be drunk. On the former, a person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
may get tipsy several times of a night. The
fixed air evolved from it produces a feeling analogous
to ebriety, independent of the spirit it contains,
Port, Sherry, and Madeira, are heavier wines, and
have a stronger tendency to excite headach and
fever.</p>

<p>The wine-bibber has usually an ominous rotundity
of face, and, not unfrequently, of corporation. His
nose is well studded over with carbuncles of the
Claret complexion; and the red of his cheeks
resembles very closely the hue of that wine. The
drunkard from ardent spirits is apt to be a poor,
miserable, emaciated figure, broken in mind and in
fortune; but the votary of the juice of the grape
may usually boast the “paunch well lined with
capon,” and calls to recollection the bluff figure of
Sir John Falstaff over his potations of Sack.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p class="section">III. <i>Modified by Malt Liquors.</i>—Malt Liquors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
under which title we include all kinds of porter
and ales, produce the worst species of drunkenness;
as, in addition to the intoxicating principle, some
noxious ingredients are usually added, for the purpose
of preserving them and giving them their
bitter. The hop of these fluids is highly narcotic,
and brewers often add other substances, to heighten
its effect, such as hyoscyamus, opium, belladonna,
cocculus Indicus, lauro cerasus, &amp;c. Malt liquors,
therefore, act in two ways upon the body, partly
by the alcohol they contain, and partly by the
narcotic principle. In addition to this, the fermentation
which they undergo is much less perfect
than that of spirits or wine. After being swallowed,
this process is carried on in the stomach,
by which fixed air is copiously liberated, and the
digestion of delicate stomachs materially impaired.
Cider, Spruce, ginger, and table beers, in consequence
of their imperfect fermentation, often
produce the same bad effects, long after their first
briskness has vanished.</p>

<p>Persons addicted to malt liquors increase enormously
in bulk. They become loaded with fat:
their chin gets double or triple, the eye prominent,
and the whole face bloated and stupid. Their circulation
is clogged, while the pulse feels like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
cord, and is full and labouring, but not quick.
During sleep, the breathing is stertorous. Every
thing indicates an excess of blood; and when a
pound or two is taken away, immense relief is
obtained. The blood, in such cases, is more dark
and sizy than in the others. In seven cases out of
ten, malt-liquor drunkards die of apoplexy or
palsy. If they escape this hazard, swelled liver or
dropsy carries them off. The abdomen seldom
loses its prominency, but the lower extremities get
ultimately emaciated. Profuse bleedings frequently
ensue from the nose, and save life, by emptying the
blood-vessels of the brain.</p>

<p>The drunkenness in question is peculiarly of
British growth. The most noted examples of it
are to be found in innkeepers and their wives,
recruiting sergeants, guards of stage-coaches, &amp;c.
The quantity of malt liquors which such persons
will consume in a day is prodigious. Seven English
pints is quite a common allowance, and not unfrequently
twice that quantity is taken without any
perceptible effect. Many of the coal-heavers on the
Thames think nothing of drinking daily two gallons
of porter, especially in the summer season, when
they labour under profuse perspirations. A friend
has informed me that he knew an instance of one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
them having consumed eighteen pints in one day,
and he states that there are many such instances.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The effects of malt liquors on the body, if not so
immediately rapid as those of ardent spirits, are
more stupifying, more lasting, and less easily removed.
The last are particularly prone to produce
levity and mirth, but the first have a stunning influence
upon the brain, and, in a short time, render
dull and sluggish the gayest disposition. They also
produce sickness and vomiting more readily than
either spirits or wine.</p>

<p>Both wine and malt liquors have a greater tendency
to swell the body than ardent spirits. They
form blood with greater rapidity, and are altogether
more nourishing. The most dreadful effects, upon
the whole, are brought on by spirits, but drunkenness
from malt liquors is the most speedily fatal.
The former break down the body by degrees; the
latter operate by some instantaneous apoplexy or
rapid inflammation.</p>

<p>No one has ever given the respective characters
of the malt-liquor and ardent-spirit drunkard with
greater truth than Hogarth, in his Beer Alley and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Gin Lane. The first is represented as plump, rubicund,
and bloated; the second as pale, tottering,
and emaciated, and dashed over with the aspect of
blank despair.</p>

<p class="section">IV. <i>Modified by Opium.</i>—The drunkenness produced
by opium has also some characteristics which
it is necessary to mention. The drug is principally
employed by the Mahometans. By their religion,
these people are forbidden the use of wine,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
use opium as a substitute. And a delightful substitute
it is while the first excitation continues; for
the images it occasions in the mind are more exquisite
than any produced even by wine.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that the use of this
medicine has, of late years, gained ground in Great
Britain. We are told by the “English Opium-Eater,”
whose powerful and interesting “Confessions”
have excited so deep an interest, that the
practice exists among the work people at Manchester.
Many of our fashionable ladies have recourse
to it when troubled with vapours, or low spirits:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
some of them even carry it about with them for the
purpose. This practice is most pernicious, and no
way different from that of drunkards, who swallow
wine and other liquors to drive away care. While
the first effects continue, the intended purpose is
sufficiently gained, but the melancholy which follows
is infinitely greater than can be compensated
by the previous exhilaration.</p>

<p>Opium acts differently on different constitutions.
While it disposes some to calm, it arouses others to
fury. Whatever passion predominates at the time,
it increases; whether it be love, or hatred, or revenge,
or benevolence. Lord Kaimes, in his Sketches
of Man, speaks of the fanatical Faquirs, who, when
excited by this drug, have been known with poisoned
daggers, to assail and butcher every European
whom they could overcome. In the century before
last, one of this nation attacked a body of Dutch
sailors, and murdered seventeen of them in one
minute. The Malays are strongly addicted to
opium. When violently aroused by it, they sometimes
perform what is called <i>Running-a-Muck</i>, which
consists in rushing out in a state of phrensied excitement,
heightened by fanaticism, and murdering
every one who comes in their way. The Turkish
commanders are well aware of the powers of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
drug in inspiring an artificial courage; and frequently
give it to their men when they put them
on any enterprise of great danger.</p>

<p>Some minds are rendered melancholy by opium.
Its usual effect, however, is to give rise to lively
and happy sensations. The late Duchess of Gordon
is said to have used it freely, previous to appearing
in great parties, where she wished to shine by the
gaiety of her conversation and brilliancy of her wit.
A celebrated pleader at the Scotch bar is reported
to do the same thing, and always with a happy
effect.</p>

<p>In this country opium is much used, but seldom
with the view of producing intoxication. Some,
indeed, deny that it can do so, strictly speaking. If
by intoxication is meant a state precisely similar to
that from over-indulgence in vinous or spirituous
liquors, they are undoubtedly right; but drunkenness
merits a wider latitude of signification. The
ecstasies of opium are much more entrancing than
those of wine. There is more poetry in its visions—more
mental aggrandizement—more range of
imagination. Wine, in common with it, invigorates
the animal powers and propensities, but opium, in a
more peculiar manner, strengthens those proper to
man, and gives, for a period amounting to hours, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
higher tone to the intellectual faculties. It inspires
the mind with a thousand delightful images, lifts the
soul from earth, and casts a halo of poetic thought
and feeling over the spirits of the most unimaginative.
Under its influence, the mind wears no longer
that blank passionless aspect which, even in gifted
natures, it is apt to assume. On the contrary, it is
clothed with beauty “as with a garment,” and
colours every thought that passes through it with
the hues of wonder and romance. Such are the
feelings which the luxurious and opulent Mussulman
seeks to enjoy. To stir up the languid current
of his mind, satiated with excess of pleasure and
rendered sluggish by indolence, he has recourse to
that remedy which his own genial climate produces
in greatest perfection. Seated perhaps amid the
luxuries of Oriental splendour—with fountains bubbling
around, and the citron shading him with its
canopy, and scattering perfume on all sides—he lets
loose the reins of an imagination conversant from
infancy with every thing gorgeous and magnificent.
The veil which shades the world of fancy is withdrawn,
and the wonders lying behind it exposed to
view; he sees palaces and temples in the clouds; or
the Paradise of Mahomet, with its houris and bowers
of amaranth, may stand revealed to his excited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
senses. Every thing is steeped in poetic exaggeration.
The zephyrs seem converted into aërial music,
the trees bear golden fruit, the rose blushes with
unaccustomed beauty and perfume. Earth, in a
word, is brought nearer to the sky, and becomes
one vast Eden of pleasure. Such are the first effects
of opium; but in proportion as they are great, so is
the depression which succeeds them. Languor and
exhaustion invariably come after; to remove which,
the drug is again had recourse to, and becomes
almost an essential of existence.</p>

<p>Opium retains at all times its power of exciting
the imagination, provided sufficient doses are taken.
But when it has been continued so long as to bring
disease upon the constitution, the pleasurable feelings
wear away, and are succeeded by others of a
very different kind. Instead of disposing the mind
to be happy, it now acts upon it like the spell of a
demon, and calls up phantoms of horror and disgust.
The fancy is still as powerful as ever, but it is
turned in another direction. Formerly it clothed
all objects with the light of heaven; now it invests
them with the attributes of hell. Goblins, spectres,
and every kind of distempered vision haunt the
mind, peopling it with dreary and revolting imagery.
The sleep is no longer cheered with its former sights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of happiness. Frightful dreams usurp their place,
till, at last, the person becomes the victim of an
almost perpetual misery.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Nor is this confined to
the mind alone, for the body suffers in an equal
degree. Emaciation, loss of appetite, sickness, vomiting,
and a total disorganization of the digestive
functions, as well as of the mental powers, are sure
to ensue, and never fail to terminate in death, if the
evil habit which brings them on is continued.</p>

<p>Opium resembles the other agents of intoxication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
in this, that the fondness for it increases with use,
and that at last, it becomes nearly essential for
bodily comfort and peace of mind. The quantity
which may be taken varies exceedingly, and depends
wholly upon age, constitution, and habit. A single
drop of laudanum has been known to kill a newborn
child; and four grains of solid opium have
destroyed an adult. Certain diseases, such as fevers,
phrensies, &amp;c., facilitate the action of opium upon
the system; others, such as diarrhœa, cramp, &amp;c.,
resist it; and a quantity which would destroy life
in the former, would have little perceptible effect
in the latter. By habit, enormous quantities of the
drug may be taken with comparative impunity.
There are many persons in this country who make
a practice of swallowing half an ounce of laudanum
night and morning, and some will even take from
one to two drachms daily of solid opium. The
Teriakis, or opium-eaters of Constantinople, will
sometimes swallow a hundred grains at a single
dose. Nay, it is confidently affirmed that some of
them will take at once three drachms in the morning,
and repeat the same dose at night, with no other
effect than a pleasing exhilaration of spirits. The
“English Opium-Eater” himself furnishes one of
the most extraordinary instances on record of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
power of habit in bringing the body to withstand
this drug. He took daily <i>eight thousand drops</i> of
laudanum, containing <i>three hundred and twenty grains</i>
of opium. This enormous quantity he reduced suddenly,
and without any considerable effort, to <i>one
thousand drops</i>, or <i>forty grains</i>. “Instantaneously,”
says he, “and as if by magic, the cloud of profoundest
melancholy which rested upon my brain,
like some black vapours which I have seen roll away
from the summits of the mountains, drew off in one
day—passed off with its murky banners, as simultaneously
as a ship that has been stranded, and is
floated off by the spring-tide.”</p>

<p>The circumstance of the body being brought by
degrees to withstand a great quantity of opium is
not solitary, but exists as a general rule with regard
to all stimulants and narcotics. A person who is
in the habit of drinking ale, wine, or spirits, will
take much more with impunity than one who is not;
and the faculty of withstanding these agents goes
on strengthening till it acquires a certain point,
after which it becomes weakened. When this takes
place, there is either organic disease or general
debility. A confirmed drunkard, whose constitution
has suffered from indulgence, cannot take so
much liquor, without feeling it, as one who is in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
habit of taking his glass, but whose strength is yet
unimpaired. It is, I suspect, the same, though
probably in a less degree, with regard to opium.</p>

<p>Mithridates, king of Pontus, affords an instance
of the effects of habit in enabling the body to withstand
poisons; and on the same principle, we find
that physicians and nurses who are much exposed
to infection, are less liable to take it than those
persons whose frames are not similarly fortified.</p>

<p>Opium resembles wine, spirit, and ales, in affecting
the brain and disposing to apoplexy. Taken
in an overdose, it is fatal in from six to twenty-four
hours, according to the quantity swallowed, and the
constitution, habits, &amp;c., of the person submitted to
its operation. The following are the principal
symptoms of poisoning from opium. Giddiness
succeeded by stupor; insensibility to light, while
the eyes are closed, and the pupil immoveable, and
sometimes dilated. The pulse is generally small
and feeble, but, occasionally, slow and full, as in
common apoplexy. The breathing at first is scarcely
perceptible, but is apt to become stertorous. Foam
sometimes issues from the mouth: in other cases
there is vomiting. The countenance is cadaverous
and pale or livid. A narcotic odour is often perceptible
in the breath. The skin is cold, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
body exceedingly relaxed; now and then it is convulsed.
By being struck, shaken, or excited any
way, the person sometimes recovers for a short
period from his stupor, and stares wildly around
him, but only to relapse into lethargy. At last
death ensues, but shortly before this event, a deceitful
show of animation occasionally makes its appearance,
and may impose upon superficial observers.</p>

<p>I extract the following interesting case of opium-eating
from a London paper:—</p>

<p>“An inquest was held at Walpole lately, on the
body of Rebecca Eason, aged five years, who had
been diseased from her birth, was unable to walk
or articulate, and from her size did not appear to
be more than <i>five weeks</i> old. The mother had for
many years been in the habit of taking opium in
large quantities, (nearly a quarter of an ounce
a-day;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>) and, it is supposed, had entailed a disease
on her child which caused its death; it was reduced
to a mere skeleton, and had been in that state from
birth. Verdict; ‘Died by the visitation of God;
but from the great quantity of opium taken by the
mother during her pregnancy of the said child, and
of suckling it, she had greatly injured its health.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
It appeared that the mother of the deceased had had
five children; that she began to take opium after
the birth and weaning of her first child, which was
and is remarkably healthy; and that the other
children have all lingered and died in the same
emaciated state as the child who was the subject of
this investigation. The mother is under thirty:
she was severely censured by the coroner for indulging
in so pernicious a practice.”</p>

<p class="section">V. <i>Modified by Tobacco.</i>—A variety of drunkenness
is excited by tobacco. This luxury was introduced
into Europe from the New World, in 1559,
by a Spanish gentleman, named Hernandez de
Toledo, who brought a small quantity into Spain
and Portugal. From thence, by the agency of the
French ambassador at Lisbon, it found its way to
Paris, where it was used in the form of powder by
Catherine de Medicis, the abandoned instigator of
the massacre of the Protestants on St. Bartholomew’s
day. This woman, therefore, may be considered
the inventor of snuff, as well as the contriver
of that most atrocious transaction. It then came
under the patronage of the Cardinal Santa Crocé,
the Pope’s nuncio, who returning from his embassy
at the Spanish and Portuguese courts, carried the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
plant to his own country, and thus acquired a fame
little inferior to that which, at another period, he
had won by piously bringing a portion of the <i>real</i>
cross from the Holy Land. It was received with
general enthusiasm in the Papal States, and hardly
less favourably in England, into which it was introduced
by Sir Walter Raleigh, in 1585. It was not,
however, without opposition that it gained a footing
either in this country or in the rest of Europe. Its
principal opponents were the priests, the physicians,
and the sovereign princes: by the former, its use
was declared sinful; and in 1624, Pope Urban VIII.
published a bull, excommunicating all persons found
guilty of taking snuff when in church. This bull
was renewed in 1690 by Pope Innocent; and about
twenty-nine years afterwards, the Sultan Amurath
IV. made smoking a capital offence, on the ground
of its producing infertility. For a long time smoking
was forbidden in Russia, under the pain of
having the nose cut off: and in some parts of Switzerland,
it was likewise made a subject of public
prosecution—the public regulations of the Canton
of Berne, in 1661, placing the prohibition of smoking
in the list of the ten commandments, immediately
under that against adultery. Nay, that
British Solomon, James I., did not think it beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the royal dignity to take up his pen upon the subject.
He accordingly, in 1603, published his famous
“Counterblaste to Tobacco,” in which the following
remarkable passage occurs:—“It is a custom loathesome
to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the
braine, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black
stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible
Stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
But notwithstanding this regal and sacerdotal
wrath, the plant extended itself far and wide, and is
at this moment the most universal luxury in existence.</p>

<p>The effects of tobacco are considerably different
from those of any other inebriating agent. Instead
of quickening, it lowers the pulse, and, when used to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
excess, produces languor, depression of the system,
giddiness, confusion of ideas, violent pain in the
stomach, vomiting, convulsions, and even death. Its
essential oil is so intensely powerful, that two or
three drops inserted into a raw wound, would prove
almost instantly fatal.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Mr. Barrow, in his travels,
speaks of the use made by the Hottentots of this
plant, for the purpose of destroying snakes. “A
Hottentot,” says he, “applied some of it from the
short end of his wooden tobacco pipe to the mouth
of a snake while darting out his tongue. The effect
was as instantaneous as an electric shock; with a
convulsive motion that was momentary, the snake
half untwisted itself, and never stirred more; and
the muscles were so contracted, that the whole
animal felt hard and rigid, as if dried in the sun.”
When used in moderation, tobacco has a soothing
effect upon the mind, disposing to placid enjoyment,
and mellowing every passion into repose. Its effects,
therefore, are inebriating; and those who habitually
indulge in it may with propriety be denominated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
drunkards. In whatever form it is used, it produces
sickness, stupor, bewilderment, and staggering
in those unaccustomed to its use. There is no
form in which it can be taken that is not decidedly
injurious and disgusting. The whole, from snuffing
to plugging, are at once so utterly uncleanly and
unnatural, that it is incredible in what manner they
ever insinuated themselves into civilized society.
A vast quantity of valuable time is wasted by the
votaries of tobacco, especially by the smokers; and
that the devotees of snuff are not greatly behind in
this respect, will be shown by the following singular
calculation of Lord Stanhope:—</p>

<p>“Every professed, inveterate, and incurable snuff-taker,”
says his Lordship, “at a moderate computation,
takes one pinch in ten minutes. Every pinch,
with the agreeable ceremony of blowing and wiping
the nose, and other incidental circumstances, consumes
a minute and a half. One minute and a half
out of every ten, allowing sixteen hours to a snuff-taking
day, amounts to two hours and twenty-four
minutes out of every natural day, or one day out of
ten. One day out of every ten, amounts to thirty-six
days and a half in a year. Hence, if we suppose
the practice to be persisted in forty years, two
entire years of the snuff-taker’s life will be dedicated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
to tickling his nose, and two more to blowing it.
The expense of snuff, snuff-boxes, and handkerchiefs
will be the subject of a second essay, in which it will
appear that this luxury encroaches as much on the
income of the snuff-taker as it does on his time; and
that by proper application of the time and money
thus lost to the public, a fund might be constituted
for the discharge of the national debt.”</p>

<p>But this is not the worst of snuffing, for though a
moderate quantity taken now and then, may do no
harm, yet, in the extent to which habitual snuffers
carry it, it is positively pernicious. The membrane
which lines the nose gets thickened, the olfactory
nerves blunted, and the sense of smell consequently
impaired. Not is this all, for, by the strong inspirations
which are made when the powder is drawn up,
some of the latter is pretty sure to escape into the
stomach. This organ is thence directly subjected to
a powerful medicine, which not only acts as a narcotic
but produces heartburn, and every other symptom
of indigestion. It is generally believed that
Napoleon owed his death to the morbid state of his
stomach produced by excessive snuffing. Snuffing
has also a strong tendency to give a determination
to the head, and on this account plethoric subjects
should be the very last ever to enter upon the habit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
If it were attended with no other inconvenience, the
black loathsome discharge from the nose, and swelling
and rubicundity of this organ, with other circumstances
equally disagreeable, ought to deter
every man from becoming a snuffer.</p>

<p>The smoker while engaged at <i>his</i> occupation, is
even a happier man than the snuffer. An air of
peculiar satisfaction beams upon his countenance;
and, as he puffs forth volumes of fragrance, he seems
to dwell in an atmosphere of contented happiness.
His illusions have not the elevated and magnificent
character of those brought on by opium or wine.
There is nothing of Raphael or Michael Angelo in
their composition—nothing of the Roman or Venetian
schools—nothing of Milton’s sublimity, or Ariosto’s
dazzling romance; but there is something
equally delightful, and in its way, equally perfect.
His visions stand in the same relation to those of
opium or wine, as the Dutch pictures of Ostade to
the Italian ones of Paul Veronese—as Washington
Irving to Lord Byron—or as Izaak Walton to Froissart.
There is an air of delightful homeliness about
them. He does not let his imagination run riot in
the clouds, but restrains it to the lower sphere of
earth, and meditates delightfully in this less elevated
region. If his fancy be unusually brilliant, or somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
heated by previous drinking, he may see thousands
of strange forms floating in the tobacco smoke.
He may people it, according to his temperament,
with agreeable or revolting images—with flowers
and gems springing up, as in dreams, before him—or
with reptiles, serpents, and the whole host of
<i>diablerie</i>, skimming, like motes in the sunshine,
amid its curling wreaths.</p>

<p>This is all that can be said in favour of smoking,
and quite enough to render the habit too common
to leave any hope of its suppression, either by the
weapons of ridicule, or the more summary plan of
the Sultan Amurath. In no sense, except as affording
a temporary gratification, can it be justified or
defended. It pollutes the breath, blackens the teeth,
wastes the saliva which is required for digestion,
and injures the complexion. In addition to this, it
is apt to produce dyspepsia, and other disorders of
the stomach; and, in corpulent subjects, it disposes
to apoplexy. At the present moment, smoking is
fashionable, and crowds of young men are to be seen
at all hours walking the streets with cigars in their
mouths, annoying the passengers. They seem to
consider it manly to be able to smoke a certain number,
without reflecting that there is scarcely an old
woman in the country who would not beat them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
naught with their own weapons, and that they would
gain no sort of honour were they able to outsmoke
all the burgomasters of Amsterdam. As the practice,
however, seems more resorted to by these young
gentlemen for the sake of effect, and of exhibiting
a little of the <i>haut ton</i>, than for any thing else, it is
likely soon to die a natural death among them; particularly
as jockeys and porters have lately taken
the field in the same way, being determined that no
class of the community shall enjoy the exclusive
monopoly of street smoking.</p>

<p>The observations made upon the effects of snuffing
and smoking, apply in a still stronger degree to
chewing. This is the worst way for the health in
which tobacco can be used. The waste of saliva is
greater than even in smoking, and the derangements
of the digestive organs proportionably severe. All
confirmed chewers are more than usually subject to
dyspepsia and hypochondriasis; and many of them
are afflicted with liver complaint, brought on by
their imprudent habit.</p>

<p>The most innocent, and, at the same time, most
disgusting way of using tobacco, is plugging, which
consists in inserting a short roll of the plant in the
nostril and allowing it to remain there so long as
the person feels disposed. Fortunately this habit is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
as rare as it is abominable; and it is to be hoped
that it will never become common in Great Britain.</p>

<p>I have observed, that persons who are much addicted
to liquor have an inordinate liking to tobacco
in all its different forms: and it is remarkable that
in the early stages of ebriety almost every man is
desirous of having a pinch of snuff. This last fact
it is not easy to explain, but the former may be accounted
for by that incessant craving after excitement
which clings to the system of the confirmed drunkard.</p>

<p>From several of the foregoing circumstances, we
are justified in considering tobacco closely allied to
intoxicating liquors, and its confirmed votaries as a
species of drunkards. At least, it is certain that,
when used to excess, it gives birth to many of the
corporeal and mental manifestations of ebriety.</p>

<p class="section">VI. <i>Modified by Nitrous Oxide.</i>—The drunkenness,
if it merit that name, from inhaling nitrous
oxide, is likewise of a character widely differing from
intoxication in general. This gas was discovered by
Dr. Priestley, but its peculiar effects upon the human
body were first perceived in 1799, by Sir Humphry
Davy, who, in the following year, published a very
elaborate account of its nature and properties, interspersed
with details by some of the most eminent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
literary and scientific characters, of the sensations
they experienced on receiving it into their lungs.</p>

<p>According to these statements, on breathing the
gas the pulse is accelerated, and a feeling of heat and
expansion pervades the chest. The most vivid and
highly pleasurable ideas pass, at the same time,
through the mind; and the imagination is exalted
to a pitch of entrancing ecstasy. The hearing is
rendered more acute, the face is flushed, and the
body seems so light that the person conceives himself
capable of rising up and mounting into the air.
Some assume theatrical attitudes; others laugh immoderately,
and stamp upon the ground. There is
an universal increase of muscular power, attended
with the most exquisite delight. In a few cases
there are melancholy, giddiness, and indistinct
vision; but generally the feelings are those of perfect
pleasure. After these strange effects have
ceased, no debility ensues, like that which commonly
follows high excitement. On the contrary, the mind
is strong and collected, and the body unusually
vigorous for some hours after the operation.</p>

<p>At the time of the discovery of the effects of nitrous
oxide, strong hopes were excited that it might
prove useful in various diseases. These, unfortunately,
have not been realized. Even the alleged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
properties of the gas have now fallen into some
discredit. That it has produced remarkable effects
cannot be denied, but there is much reason for thinking,
that in many cases, these were in a great measure
brought about by the influence of imagination.
Philosophers seem to be divided on this point, and
their conflicting testimonies it is not easy to reconcile.
Having tried the experiment of inhaling the
gas myself, and having seen it tried upon others, I
have no doubt that there is much truth in the reports
originally published of its properties, although in
many cases, imagination has made these appear
greater than they really are. The intoxication
which it produces is entirely one <i>sui generis</i>, and
differs so much from that produced by other agents,
that it can hardly be looked upon as the same
thing.</p>

<p>The effects of nitrous oxide upon myself, though
considerable, were not so striking as I have seen upon
others. The principal feelings produced, were giddiness
and violent beating in the head, such as occur
in the acmé of drunkenness. There was also a strong
propensity to laugh: it occurs to me, however, that
in my own case, and probably in some others, the
risible tendency might be controlled by a strong
effort of volition, in the same way as in most cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of drunkenness, were the effort imperatively requisite.
Altogether I experienced nearly the sensations
of highly excited ebriety. There was the same
seeming lightness and expansion of the head, the
same mirthfulness of spirit, and the same inordinate
propensity to do foolish things, knowing them to be
foolish, as occur in drunkenness in general. I was
perfectly aware what I was about, and could, I am
persuaded, with some effort, have subjected the
whimsies of fancy to the soberer dictates of judgment.
In a word, the gas produced precisely a temporary
paroxysm of drunkenness, and such a determination
of blood upwards as rendered the complexion livid,
and left behind some degree of headach. Such are
the effects upon myself, but with most people, there
is a total unconsciousness of the part they are acting.
They perform the most extravagant pranks, and on
recovering their self-possession are totally ignorant
of the circumstance. Sometimes the gas has an
opposite effect, and the person instantly drops down
insensible, as if struck by lightning: he recovers,
however, immediately. Those who wish to know
more of this curious subject, should read Sir H.
Davy’s work; but, above all, they should try the gas
upon themselves. In the meantime I shall lay before
the reader the details, in their own words, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the sensations experienced by Messrs. Edgeworth
and Coleridge, and by Dr. Kinglake.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edgeworth’s Case</span>.—“My first sensation
was an universal and considerable tremor. I then
perceived some giddiness in my head, and a violent
dizziness in my sight; these sensations by degrees
subsided, and I felt a great propensity to bite through
the wooden mouth-piece, or the tube of the bag
through which I inspired the air. After I had
breathed all the air that was in the bag, I eagerly
wished for more. I then felt a strong propensity to
laugh, and did burst into a violent fit of laughter, and
capered about the room without having the power of
restraining myself. By degrees, these feelings subsided,
except the tremor, which lasted for an hour
after I had breathed the air, and I felt a weakness in
my knees. The principal feeling through the whole
of the time, or what I should call the characteristical
part of the effect, was a total difficulty of restraining
my feelings, both corporeal and mental, or, in
other words, not having any command of myself.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Coleridge’s Case</span>.—“The first time I inspired
the nitrous oxide, I felt an highly pleasurable
sensation of warmth over my whole frame, resembling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
that which I once remember to have experienced
after returning from a walk in the snow into a warm
room. The only motion which I felt inclined to
make, was that of laughing at those who were looking
at me. My eyes felt distended, and, towards
the last, my heart beat as if it were leaping up and
down. On removing the mouth-piece, the whole
sensation went off almost instantly.</p>

<p>“The second time, I felt the same pleasurable
sensation of warmth, but not, I think, in quite so
great a degree. I wished to know what effect it
would have on my impressions: I fixed my eye on
some trees in the distance, but I did not find any
other effect, except that they became dimmer and
dimmer, and looked at last as if I had seen them
through tears. My heart beat more violently than
the first time. This was after a hearty dinner.</p>

<p>“The third time, I was more violently acted on
than in the two former. Towards the last, I could
not avoid, nor indeed felt any wish to avoid, beating
the ground with my feet; and, after the mouth-piece
was removed, I remained for a few seconds
motionless, in great ecstasy.</p>

<p>“The fourth time was immediately after breakfast.
The first few inspirations affected me so little, that
I thought Mr. Davy had given me atmospheric air;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
but soon felt the warmth beginning about my chest,
and spreading upward and downward, so that I
could feel its progress over my whole frame. My
heart did not beat so violently; my sensations were
highly pleasurable, not so intense or apparently
local, but of more unmingled pleasure than I had
ever before experienced.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Kinglake’s Case</span>.—“My first inspiration of
it was limited to four quarts, diluted with an equal
quantity of atmospheric air. After a few inspirations,
a sense of additional freedom and power (call
it energy, if you please) agreeably pervaded the
region of the lungs; this was quickly succeeded by
an almost delirious but highly pleasurable sensation
in the brain, which was soon diffused over the whole
frame, imparting to the muscular power at once an
increased disposition and tone for action; but the
mental effect of the excitement was such as to absorb
in a sort of intoxicating placidity and delight, volition,
or rather the power of voluntary motion. These
effects were in a greater or less degree protracted
during about five minutes, when the former state
returned, with the difference however of feeling
more cheerful and alert, for several hours after.</p>

<p>“It seemed also to have had the further effect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
reviving rheumatic irritations in the shoulder and
knee-joints, which had not been previously felt for
many months. No perceptible change was induced
in the pulse, either at or subsequent to the time of
inhaling the gas.</p>

<p>“The effects produced by a second trial of its
powers, were more extensive, and concentrated on
the brain. In this instance, nearly six quarts undiluted,
were accurately and fully inhaled. As on the
former occasion, it immediately proved agreeably
respirable, but before the whole quantity was quite
exhausted, its agency was exerted so strongly on
the brain, as progressively to suspend the senses of
seeing, hearing, feeling, and ultimately the power of
volition itself. At this period, the pulse was much
augmented both in force and frequency; slight convulsive
twitches of the muscles of the arms were
also induced; no painful sensation, nausea, or languor,
however, either preceded, accompanied, or
followed this state, nor did a minute elapse before
the brain rallied, and resumed its wonted faculties,
when a sense of glowing warmth extending over
the system, was speedily succeeded by a re-instatement
of the equilibrium of health.</p>

<p>“The more permanent effects were (as in the
first experiment) an invigorated feel of vital power,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
improved spirits, transient irritations in different
parts, but not so characteristically rheumatic as in
the former instance.</p>

<p>“Among the circumstances most worthy of regard
in considering the properties and administration of
this powerful aërial agent, may be ranked, the fact
of its being, contrary to the prevailing opinion, both
highly respirable, and salutary; that it impresses the
brain and system at large with a more or less strong
and durable degree of pleasurable sensation; that,
unlike the effect of other violently exciting agents,
no sensible exhaustion or diminution of vital power
accrues from the exertions of its stimulant property;
that its most excessive operation even, is neither
permanently nor transiently debilitating; and finally,
that it fairly promises, under judicious application,
to prove an extremely efficient remedy, as well in
the vast tribe of diseases originating from deficient
irritability and sensibility, as in those proceeding
from morbid associations, and modifications of those
vital principles.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">ENUMERATION OF THE LESS COMMON INTOXICATING AGENTS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In this Chapter, I shall content myself with the
enumeration of a few of the less common intoxicating
agents. To detail all the productions of
nature which have the power of inebriating, would
be an endless and uninteresting topic.</p>

<p class="section"><i>Hemlock.</i>—A powerful narcotic, producing giddiness,
elevation of spirits, and other symptoms of
ebriety. It was by an infusion of the leaf of this
plant that Socrates was poisoned.</p>

<p><i>Leopard’s-bane.</i>—(<i>Arnica montana.</i>)—Properties
analogous to those of hemlock and other narcotics.</p>

<p><i>Bangue.</i>—This is the leaf of a species of wild
hemp, growing on the shores of Turkey, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Grecian Archipelago. It possesses many of the
properties of opium, and is used by the poorer
classes of Mussulmen as a substitute for this drug.
Before being used, it is dried, and the exsiccated
leaves are either chewed entire, or reduced into a
fine powder, and made into pills. Its effects are to
elevate the spirits, dispel melancholy, and give increased
energy to the corporeal faculties—followed
by languor both of body and mind.</p>

<p><i>Hop.</i>—Similar in its effects to opium, only inferior
in degree. Used in porter brewing.</p>

<p><i>Wolf’s-bane.</i>—(<i>Aconitum napellus.</i>)—A most
deadly narcotic, producing, in small doses, the usual
symptoms of ebriety, such as giddiness, elevation of
spirits, &amp;c. When taken to excess it is inevitably
fatal.</p>

<p><i>Cocculus Indicus.</i>—The intoxicating powers of
this berry are considerable. It is used by the
brewers to increase the strength of porter and ales;
and is sometimes thrown into ponds for the purpose
of intoxicating the fishes, that they may thereby be
more easily caught.</p>

<p><i>Foxglove.</i>—(<i>Digitalis.</i>)—Likewise a powerful
narcotic, and capable of producing many of the
symptoms of drunkenness. It has the peculiar effect
of lowering, instead of raising the pulse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p><i>Nightshade.</i>-(<i>Belladonna.</i>)—This is one of the
most virulent narcotics we possess. Like opium,
hop, and cocculus Indicus, it is used by brewers to
augment the intoxicating properties of malt liquors.
“The Scots,” says Buchanan, “mixed a quantity
of the juice of the belladonna with the bread and
drink, with which, by their truce, they were bound
to supply the Danes, which so intoxicated them,
that the Scots killed the greater part of Sweno’s
army.”</p>

<p>“Some children ate, in a garden, the fruit of the
belladonna, (<i>deadly nightshade</i>.) Shortly after, they
had burning fever, with convulsions, and very strong
palpitations of the heart: they lost their senses, and
became completely delirious: one of them, four
years of age, died the next day: the stomach contained
some berries of the belladonna crushed, and
some seeds; it exhibited three ulcers; the heart
was livid, and the pericardium without serosity.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“One child ate four ripe berries of the belladonna,
another ate six. Both one and the other
were guilty of extravagancies which astonished the
mother; their pupils were dilated; their countenances
no longer remained the same; they had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
cheerful delirium, accompanied with fever. The
physician being called in, found them in a state of
great agitation, talking at random, running, jumping,
laughing sardonically; their countenances purple,
and pulses hurried. He administered to each
of them half a grain of emetic tartar and a drachm
of Glauber salt, in four or five ounces of water;
they had copious evacuations during seven or eight
hours, and the symptoms disappeared.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><i>Henbane.</i>—(<i>Hyoscyamus.</i>)—Similar in its properties
to nightshade and opium. The intoxicating
properties of hyoscyamus appear to have been
known from a very early period. It was with this
plant that the Assassin Prince, commonly called the
“Old Man of the Mountain,” inebriated his followers
preparatory to installing them into his service.
The following eloquent passage from a modern
writer will prove interesting:—</p>

<p>“There was at Alamoot, and also at Masiat, in
Syria, a delicious garden, encompassed with lofty
walls, adorned with trees and flowers of every kind—with
murmuring brooks and translucent lakes—with
bowers of roses and trelisses of the vine—airy
halls and splendid kiosks, furnished with carpets of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Persia and silks of Byzantium. Beautiful maidens
and blooming boys were the inhabitants of this
delicious spot, which resounded with the melody of
birds, the murmur of streams, and the tones and
voices of instruments—all respired contentment and
pleasure. When the chief had noticed any youth
to be distinguished for strength and resolution, he
invited him to a banquet, where he placed him
beside himself, conversed with him on the happiness
reserved for the faithful, and contrived to administer
to him an intoxicating draught, prepared from the
<i>hyoscyamus</i>. While insensible, he was conveyed to
the garden of delight, and there awakened by the
application of vinegar. On opening his eyes, all
Paradise met his view; the black-eyed and blue-robed
houris surrounded him, obedient to his wishes;
sweet music filled his ears; the richest viands were
served up in the most costly vessels, and the choicest
wines sparkled in golden cups. The fortunate
youth believed himself really in the Paradise of
the Prophet, and the language of his attendants
confirmed the delusion. When he had had his fill
of enjoyment, and nature was yielding to exhaustion,
the opiate was again administered, and the
sleeper transported back to the side of the chief, to
whom he communicated what had passed, and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
assured him of the truth and reality of all he had
experienced, telling him such was the bliss reserved
for the obedient servants of the Imaum, and enjoining,
at the same time, the strictest secrecy. Ever
after, the rapturous vision possessed the imagination
of the deluded enthusiast, and he panted for
the hour when death, received in obeying the commands
of his superior, should dismiss him to the
bowers of Paradise.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><i>Palm Wine.</i>—This is prepared from the juice
which exudes from the palm tree. Its properties
are very inebriating; and it is an amusing fact to
witness the stupor and giddiness into which the
lizards frequenting these trees are thrown, by partaking
of the juice which yields it. They exhibit
all the usual phenomena of intoxication.</p>

<p><i>Camphor.</i>—The intoxicating properties of camphor
are considerable. It elevates the spirits, increases
voluntary motion, and gives rise to vertigo;
and these effects, as in the case of all narcotics, are
succeeded by drowsiness, lassitude, and general
depression. In large doses, syncope, convulsions,
delirium, and even death, take place. It is sometimes
used as a substitute for opium in cases of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
delirium, where, from particular circumstances, the
latter either cannot be taken, or does not produce
its usual effects. The common belief, however, of
camphor being an antidote to this medicine, is quite
unfounded. It neither decomposes opium, nor prevents
it from acting poisonously upon the system:
but, in consequence of its stimulating properties, it
may be advantageously given in small doses to
remove the stupor and coma produced by opium.</p>

<p><i>Saffron.</i>—This aromatic possesses moderate intoxicating
properties. Taken in sufficient doses, it
accelerates the pulse, produces giddiness, raises the
spirits, and gives rise to paroxysms of laughter. In
a word, it exhibits many of the phenomena occasioned
by over-indulgence in liquors, only in a very
inferior degree.</p>

<p><i>Darnel.</i>—Possesses slight intoxicating properties.</p>

<p><i>Clery.</i>—Possesses slight intoxicating properties.</p>

<p><i>Carbonic Acid.</i>—Carbonic acid partially inebriates,
as is seen in drinking ginger beer, cider, Champaign,
or even soda water, in which no alcoholic
principle exists.</p>

<p><i>Ethers.</i>—Ethers, when taken in quantity, give
rise to a species of intoxication, which resembles
that from ardent spirits in all respects, except in
being more fugacious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p><i>Intense Cold.</i>—Intense cold produces giddiness,
thickness of speech, confusion of ideas, and other
symptoms of drunkenness. Captain Parry speaks
of the effects so produced upon two young gentlemen
who were exposed to an extremely low temperature.
“They looked wild,” says he, “spoke
thick and indistinctly, and it was impossible to draw
from them a rational answer, to any of our questions.
After being on board for a short time, the mental
faculties appeared gradually to return, and it was
not till then that a looker-on could easily persuade
himself that they had not been drinking too freely.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="smaller">DIFFERENCES IN THE ACTION OF OPIUM AND ALCOHOL.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The <i>modus operandi</i> of opium upon the body is considerably
different from that of alcohol. The latter
intoxicates chiefly by acting <i>directly</i> upon the nerves,
the former by acting <i>secondarily</i> upon them, through
the medium of absorption. This is easily proved
by injecting a quantity of each into the cellular
tissue of any animal, and comparing the effects with
those produced when either is received into the
stomach. M. Orfila<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> details some interesting experiments
which he made upon dogs. In applying
the watery extract of opium to them in the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
manner, (by injection into the cellular tissue,) immediate
stupor, convulsions, and debility ensued,
and proved fatal in an hour or two. When, on
the contrary, even a larger quantity was introduced
into the stomach of the animal, it survived ten,
twelve or eighteen hours, although the œsophagus
was purposely tied to prevent vomiting. The operation
of alcohol was the reverse of this; for, when
injected into the cellular substance, the effects were
slight; but when carried into the stomach, they
were powerful and almost instantaneous. This
proves that opium acts chiefly by being taken up by
the absorbents, as this is done much more rapidly
by the drug being directly applied to a raw surface
than in the stomach, where the various secretions
and processes of digestion retard its absorption.
Besides, alcohol taken in quantity produces instant
stupefaction. It is no sooner swallowed than the
person drops down insensible. Here is no time for
absorption; the whole energies of the spirit are exerted
against the nervous system. The same rapid
privation of power never occurs after swallowing
opium. There is always an interval, and generally
one of some extent, between the swallowing and the
stupor which succeeds. Another proof that opium
acts in this manner, is the circumstance of its being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
much more speedily fatal than alcohol, when injected
into the blood vessels. Three or four grains in
solution, forced into the carotid artery of a dog, will
kill him in a few minutes. Alcohol, used in the
same manner, would not bring on death for several
hours.</p>

<p>In addition it may be stated, that a species of
drunkenness is produced by inhaling the gas of intoxicating
liquors. Those employed in bottling
spirits from the cask, feel it frequently with great
severity. This proves that there is a close sympathy
between the nerves of the nose and lungs, and those
of the stomach. From all these circumstances, it is
pretty evident that intoxication from spirits is produced
more by the direct action of the fluid upon
the nerves of the latter organ, than by absorption.</p>

<p>Mr. Brodie supposes that there is no absorption
whatever of alcohol, and supports his views with a
number of striking facts.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> This, however, is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
length to which I cannot go. I am inclined to think
that though such absorption is not necessary to
produce drunkenness, it generally takes place to a
greater or lesser degree; nor can I conceive any
reason why alcohol may not be taken into the circulation
as well as any other fluid. My reasons for
supposing that it is absorbed are the following:—1.
The blood, breath, and perspiration of a confirmed
drunkard differ from those of a sober man; the
former being darker, and the two latter strongly
impregnated with a spirituous odour. 2. The perspiration
of the wine-drinker is often of the hue of
his favourite liquor; after a debauch on Port, Burgundy,
or Claret, it is not uncommon to see the
shirt or sheets in which he lies, tinted to a rosy
colour by the moisture which exudes from his body.
3. Madder, mercury, and sulphur are received into
the circulation unchanged; the former dyeing the
bones, and the others exhaling through the pores of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
the skin, so as to communicate their peculiar odours
to the person, and even discolour coins and other
metallic substances in his pockets. The first of
these reasons is a direct proof of absorption: the
second shows, that as wine is received into the circulation,
and passes through it, alcohol may do the
same; and the third furnishes collateral evidence
of other agents exhibiting this phenomenon as well
as spirituous liquors. The doctrine of absorption
is supported by Dr. Trotter,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> who conceives that
alcohol de-oxygenizes the blood, and causes it to
give out an unusual portion of hydrogen gas. The
quantity of this gas in the bodies of drunkards is so
great, that many have attempted to explain from
it the circumstances of <i>spontaneous Combustion</i>, by
which it is alleged, the human frame has been sometimes
destroyed by being burned to ashes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="smaller">PHYSIOLOGY OF DRUNKENNESS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In administering medicines, the practitioner has a
natural desire to learn the means by which they produce
their effects upon the body. Thus, he is not
contented with knowing that squill acts as a diuretic,
and that mercury increases the secretion of the bile.
He inquires by what process they do so; and understands
that the first excites into increased action the
secretory arteries of the kidneys, and the last the
secretory veins of the liver. In like manner, he does
not rest satisfied with the trite knowledge that
wines, and spirits, and ales, produce intoxication:
he extends his researches beyond this point, and is
naturally anxious to ascertain by what peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
action of the system these agents give rise to so
extraordinary an effect.</p>

<p>All the agents of which we have spoken, with
the exception of tobacco, whose action from the first
is decidedly sedative, operate partly by stimulating
the frame. They cause the heart to throb more
vigorously, and the blood to circulate freer, while,
at the same time, they exert a peculiar action upon
the nervous system. The nature of this action, it
is probable, will never be satisfactorily explained.
If mere stimulation were all that was wanted,
drunkenness ought to be present in many cases
where it is never met with. It, or more properly
speaking, its symptoms, ought to exist in inflammatory
fever, and after violent exercise, such as
running or hard walking. Inebriating agents, therefore,
with few exceptions, have a twofold action.
They both act by increasing the circulation, and by
influencing the nerves; and the latter operation,
there can be no doubt, is the more important of the
two. Having stated this general fact, it will be
better to consider the cause of each individual
symptom in detail.</p>

<p class="section">I. <i>Vertigo.</i>—This is partly produced by the
ocular delusions under which the drunkard labours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
but it is principally owing to other causes; as it is
actually greater when the eyes are shut than when
they are open—these causes, by the exclusion
of light, being unaccountably increased. Vertigo,
from intoxication, is far less liable to produce sickness
and vomiting than from any other cause; and
when it does produce them, it is to a very inconsiderable
degree. These symptoms, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, arise from the disordered
state of the stomach, and not, as we have elsewhere
mentioned, from the accompanying giddiness.
There are, indeed, a certain class of subjects who
vomit and become pale, as soon as vertigo comes
over them, but such are few in number compared
with those whose stomachs are unaffected by this
sensation. In swinging, smoking, sailing at sea, on
turning rapidly round, sickness and vomiting are
apt to occur; and there seems no doubt that they
proceed in a great measure from the vertigo brought
on by these actions. The giddiness of drunkenness,
therefore, as it very rarely sickens, must be
presumed to have some characters peculiar to itself.
In this, as well as in some other affections, it seems
to be the consequence of a close sympathy between
the brain and nerves of the stomach; and whatever
affects the latter organ, or any other viscus strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
sympathizing with it, may bring it on equally with
inebriating agents: calculi in the uterus or biliary
ducts are illustrations of this fact. In intoxication,
the giddiness is more strongly marked, because
the powers both of body and mind are temporarily
impaired, and the sensorium so disordered as to be
unable to regulate the conduct.</p>

<p>A degree of vertigo may be produced by loading
the stomach too rapidly and copiously after a long
fast. Common food, in this instance, amounts to a
strong stimulus in consequence of the state of the
stomach, in which there was an unnatural want of
excitement. This organ was in a state of torpor;
and a stimulus which, in ordinary circumstances,
would hardly have been felt, proves, in reality,
highly exciting. For the same reason, objects have
an unnatural luminousness when a person is suddenly
brought from intense darkness to a brilliant light.</p>

<p class="section">II. <i>Double Vision.</i>—The double vision which
occurs in drunkenness may be readily accounted for
by the influence of increased circulation in the brain
upon the nerves of sight. In frenzy, and various
fevers, the same phenomenon occurs. Every nerve
is supplied with vessels; and it is conceivable that
any unusual impulse of blood into the optics may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
so far affect that pair as to derange their actions.
Whence, they convey false impressions to the brain,
which is itself too much thrown off its just equilibrium
to remedy, even if that under any circumstances
were possible, the distorted images of the
retina. The refraction of light in the tears, which are
secreted more copiously than usual during intoxication,
may also assist in multiplying objects to the eye.</p>

<p class="section">III. <i>Staggering and Stammering.</i>—These symptoms
are, in like manner, to be explained from the
disordered state of the brain and nervous system.
When the organ of sensation is affected, it is
impossible that parts whose actions depend upon it
can perform their functions well. The nervous fluid
is probably carried to the muscles in a broken and
irregular current, and the filaments which are scattered
over the body are themselves directly stunned
and paralyzed; hence, the insensibility to pain, and
other external impressions. This insensibility extends
everywhere, even to the organs of deglutition
and speech. The utterance is thick and indistinct,
indicating a loss of power in the lingual nerves
which give action to the tongue; and the same
want of energy seems to prevail in the gustatory
branches which give it taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p class="section">IV. <i>Heat and Flushing.</i>—These result from the
strong determination of blood to the surface of the
body. This reddens and tumefies the face and eyes,
and excites an universal glow of heat. Blood is the
cause of animal heat, and the more it is determined
to any part, the greater is the quantity of caloric
evolved therefrom.</p>

<p class="section">V. <i>Ringing in the Ears.</i>—This is accounted for
by the generally increased action within the head,
and more particularly by the throbbing of the
internal carotid arteries which run in the immediate
neighbourhood of the ears.</p>

<p class="section">VI. <i>Elevation of Spirits.</i>—The mental pleasure
of intoxication is not easily explained on physiological
principles. We feel a delight in being rocked
gently, in swinging on a chair, or in being tickled.
These undoubtedly act upon the nerves, but in what
manner, it would be idle to attempt investigating.
Intoxicating agents no doubt do the same thing.
The mental manifestations produced by their influence
depend almost entirely upon the nerves, and
are, unlike the corporeal ones, in a great measure
independent of vascular excitement. The power of
exciting the feelings inherent in these principles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
can only be accounted for by supposing a most intimate
relation to subsist between the body and the
mind. The brain, through the medium of its nervous
branches, is the source of all this excitement.
These branches receive the impressions and convey
them to their fountain-head, whence they are showered
like sparkling rain-drops over the mind, in a
thousand fantastic varieties. No bodily affection
ever influences the mind but through the remote or
proximate agency of this organ. It sits enthroned
in the citadel of thought, and, though material itself,
acts with wizard power both upon matter and spirit.
No other texture has the same pervading principle.
If the lungs be diseased, we have expectoration and
cough; if the liver, jaundice or dropsy; if the stomach,
indigestion; but when the brain is affected,
we have not merely many bodily symptoms, but
severe affections of the mind; nor are such affections
ever produced by any organ but through the agency
of the brain. It, therefore, acts in a double capacity
upon the frame, being both the source of the
corporeal feelings, and of the mental manifestations.
Admitting this truth, there can be little difficulty in
apprehending why intoxication produces so powerful
a mental influence. This must proceed from a
resistless impulse being given to the brain, by virtue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of the peculiar action of inebriating agents upon the
nerves. That organ of the mind is suddenly
endowed with increased energy. Not only does the
blood circulate through it more rapidly, but an
action, <i>sui generis</i>, is given to its whole substance.
Mere increase of circulation, as we have already
stated, is not sufficient: there must be some other
principle at work upon its texture; and it is this
principle, whatever it may be, which is the main
cause of drunkenness. At first, ebriety has a soothing
effect, and falls over the spirit like the hum of
bees, or the distant murmur of a cascade. Then to
these soft dreams of Elysium succeed a state of maddening
energy and excitement in the brain. The
thoughts which emanate from its prolific tabernacle,
are more fervid and original than ever—they rush
out with augmented copiousness, and sparkle over
the understanding like the aurora borealis, or the
eccentric scintillations of light upon a summer cloud.
In a word, the organ is excited to a high, but not a
diseased action, for this is coupled with pain, and,
instead of pleasurable, produces afflicting ideas.
But its energies, like those of any other part, are
apt to be over-excited. When this takes place, the
balance is broken; the mind gets tumultuous and
disordered, and the ideas inconsistent, wavering, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
absurd. Then come the torpor and exhaustion
subsequent on such excessive stimulus. The person
falls into drowsiness or stupor, and his mind, as well
as his body, is followed by languor corresponding
to the previous excitation.</p>

<p class="section">Such is a slight and unsatisfactory attempt to
elucidate some of the more prominent phenomena
of drunkenness. Some are omitted as being too
obvious to require explanation, and others have
been elsewhere cursorily accounted for in different
parts of the work.</p>

<span class="smaller">METHOD OF CURING THE FIT OF DRUNKENNESS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="section">I. <i>From Liquors.</i>—Generally speaking, there is
no remedy for drunkenness equal to vomiting. The
sooner the stomach is emptied of its contents the
better, and this may, in most cases, be accomplished
by drinking freely of tepid water, and tickling the
fauces. On more obstinate occasions, powerful
emetics will be necessary. The best for this purpose,
are ten grains of sulphate of copper, half a
drachm of sulphate of zinc, or five grains of tartar
emetic. Either of these should be dissolved in
a small quantity of tepid water, and instantly
swallowed. Should this treatment fail in effecting
vomiting, and dangerous symptoms supervene, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
stomach pump should be employed. Cold applications
to the head are likewise useful. In all cases,
the head ought to be well elevated, and the neck-cloth
removed, that there may be no impediment to
the circulation. Where there is total insensibility,
where the pulse is slow and full, the pupils dilated,
the face flushed, and the breathing stertorous, it
becomes a question whether blooding might be
useful. Darwin<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and Trotter speak discouragingly
of the practice. As a general rule I think it is bad;
and that many persons who would have recovered,
if left to themselves, have lost their lives by being
prematurely bled. In all cases it should be done
cautiously, and not for a considerable time. Vomiting
and other means should invariably be first had
recourse to, and if they fail, and nature is unable of
her own power to overcome the stupor, blooding
may be tried. In this respect, liquors differ from
opium, the insensibility from which is benefited by
abstraction of blood.</p>

<p>There is one variety of drunkenness in which both
blooding and cold are inadmissible. This is when
a person is struck down, as it were, by drinking
suddenly a great quantity of ardent spirits. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
he is overcome by an instantaneous stupor: his
countenance is ghastly and pale, his pulse feeble,
and his body cold. While these symptoms continue,
there is no remedy but vomiting. When,
however, they wear off, and are succeeded, as they
usually are, by flushing, heat, and general excitement,
the case is changed, and must be treated as
any other where such symptoms exist.</p>

<p>The acetate of ammonia is said to possess singular
properties in restoring from intoxication. This
fact was ascertained by M. Masurer, a French
chemist. According to him, from twenty to thirty
drops in a glass of water, will, in most cases, relieve
the patient from the sense of giddiness and oppression
of the brain; or, if that quantity should be insufficient,
half the same may be again given in eight
or ten minutes after. In some cases the remedy
will occasion nausea or vomiting, which, however,
will be salutary to the patient, as the state of the
brain is much aggravated by the load on the stomach,
and subsequent indigestion. It is also farther stated
that the value of this medicine is greatly enhanced
from its not occasioning that heat of the stomach
and subsequent inflammation which are apt to be
produced by pure ammonia. Whether it possesses
all the virtues attributed to it, I cannot say from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
personal observation, having never had occasion to
use it in any case which came under my management;
but I think it at least promises to be useful,
and is, at all events, worthy of a trial. I must
mention, however, that the acetate of ammonia is
seldom to be procured in the highly concentrated
state in which it is used by M. Masurer. Owing
to the great difficulty of chrystallizing it, it is rarely
seen except in the fluid state, in which condition it
is recommended by the French chemist. The form
in which it is almost always used in this country,
is that of the Aq. Acet. Ammon. or Spirit of
Mindererus, in doses of half an ounce or an ounce,
but whether in this shape it would be equally
effectual in obviating the effects of drunkenness,
remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Broomley of Deptford recommends a draught
composed of two drachms of Aq. Ammon. Aromat.
in two ounces of water, as an effectual remedy in
drunkenness.</p>

<p>The carbonate of ammonia might be used with a
good effect. M. Dupuy, director to the Veterinary
School at Toulouse, tried a curious experiment with
this medicine upon a horse. Having previously
intoxicated the animal by injecting a demiletre of
alcohol into the jugular vein, he injected five grains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
of the carbonate of ammonia, dissolved in an ounce
of water, into the same vein, when the effects of the
alcohol immediately ceased.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned that the excitement
of drunkenness is succeeded by universal languor.
In the first stage, the drunkard is full of energy,
and capable of withstanding vigorously all external
influences. In the second, there is general torpor
and exhaustion, and he is more than usually subject
to every impression, whether of cold or contagion.
Persons are often picked up half dead in this second
stage. The stimulus of intoxication had enabled
them to endure the chill of the atmosphere, but the
succeeding weakness left them more susceptible than
before of its severity. In this state the body will
not sustain any farther abstraction of stimuli; and
blooding and cold would be highly injurious.
Vomiting is here equally necessary, as in all other
instances; but the person must be kept in a warm
temperature, and cherished with light and nourishing
food with soups, if such can be procured, and
even with negus, should the prostration of strength
be very great.</p>

<p>A paroxysm of <i>periodical</i> drunkenness may be
sometimes shortened by putting such small quantities
of tartar emetic into the liquor which the person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
indulges in, as to bring on nausea. This, however,
must be done with secrecy and caution.</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned, though not with a
view of recommending the practice, that the vegetable
acids have a strong effect both in counteracting
and removing drunkenness. To illustrate this
fact, the following circumstance may be mentioned:—About
twenty years ago, an English regiment was
stationed in Glasgow, the men of which, as is common
in all regiments, became enamoured of whisky.
This liquor, to which they gave the whimsical
denomination of <i>white ale</i>, was new to them—being
nearly unknown in England: and they soon indulged
in it to such an extent, as to attract the censure
of their officers. Being obliged to be at quarters
by a certain hour, they found out the plan of
sobering themselves by drinking large quantities of
vinegar, perhaps a gill or two at a draught. This,
except in very bad cases, had the desired effect, and
enabled them to enter the barrack-court, or appear
on parade, in a state of tolerable sobriety. The
power of the vegetable acids in resisting intoxication,
is well shown in the case of cold punch—a
larger portion of which can be withstood than of
either grog or toddy, even when the quantity of
spirit is precisely the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>There is nothing which has so strong a tendency
to dispel the effects of a debauch as hard exercise,
especially if the air be cold. Aperients and
diaphoretics are also extremely useful for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>For some days after drinking too much, the food
should be light and unirritating, consisting principally
of vegetables. Animal food is apt to heat the
body, and dispose it to inflammatory complaints.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p class="section">II. <i>From Opium.</i>—When a dangerous quantity
of opium has been taken, the treatment, in the first
instance, is the same as with regard to spirits, or
any other intoxicating fluid. Immediate vomiting,
by the administration of similar emetics, is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
attempted, and when it has taken place, it should be
encouraged by warm drinks, till there is reason to
believe that the stomach has been freed of the poison.
These drinks, however, should not be given before
vomiting is produced, for, in the event of their failing
to excite it, they remain upon the stomach, and
thus dissolve the opium and promote its absorption.
But when vomiting occurs from the action of the
emetics, it will in all probability be encouraged by
warm drinks, and the stomach thus more effectually
cleared of the poison. Large quantities of a strong
infusion of coffee ought then to be given, or the
vegetable acids, such as vinegar or lemon-juice,
mixed with water. These serve to mitigate the
bad consequences which often follow, even after the
opium has been brought completely up. If the
person show signs of apoplexy, more especially if he
be of a plethoric habit, the jugular vein, or temporal
artery should be opened, and a considerable quantity
of blood taken away. Indeed, it may be laid down
as a general rule, that as soon as the poison is
rejected, the patient ought to be bled, and the operation
should be repeated according to circumstances.
Every means must be used to arouse him from
stupor. He must be moved about, if possible, from
room to room, hartshorn applied to his nostrils, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
all plans adopted to prevent him from sinking into
lethargy. For this purpose, camphor, asafœtida, or
musk, might be administered with advantage. It
is also a good practice to sponge the body well with
cold water; and the affusion of cold water on the
head and over the body, is still more effectual. In
cases where vomiting cannot be brought about by
the ordinary means, M. Orfila suggests that one or
two grains of tartar emetic, dissolved in an ounce or
two of water, might be injected into the veins. In
desperate cases, the stomach pump must be had
recourse to. Purgatives are latterly necessary.</p>

<p>Many practitioners consider vinegar and the other
vegetable acids antidotes to opium. This opinion
M. Orfila has most satisfactorily shown to be erroneous.
In a series of well-conducted and conclusive
experiments made by him, it appears that the vegetable
acids aggravate the symptoms of poisoning by
opium, whenever they are not vomited. They hurry
them on more rapidly, render them more violent,
produce death at an earlier period, and give rise to
inflammation of the stomach—an event which hardly
ever occurs when they are not employed. These
effects, it would appear, are partly produced by their
power of dissolving opium, which they do better
than the mere unassisted fluids of the stomach;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
consequently the absorption is more energetic. The
only time when acids can be of use, is after the person
has brought up the poison by vomiting. They
then mitigate the subsequent symptoms, and promote
recovery; but if they be swallowed before
vomiting takes place, and if this act cannot by any
means be brought about, they aggravate the disorder,
and death ensues more rapidly than if they
had not been taken.</p>

<p>Coffee has likewise a good effect when taken
after the opium is got off the stomach; but it differs
from the acids in this, that it does not, under any
circumstances, increase the danger. While the
opium is still unremoved, the coffee may be considered
merely inert; and it is, therefore, a matter
of indifference whether at this time it be taken or
not. Afterwards, however, it produces the same
beneficial effects as lemonade, tartaric acid, or
vinegar. According to Orfila, the infusion is more
powerful as an antidote than the decoction.</p>

<p>Drunkenness or poisoning from the other
narcotics, such as hemlock, belladonna, aconite,
hyoscyamus, &amp;c., is treated in precisely the same
manner as that from opium.</p>

<p class="section">III. <i>From Tobacco.</i>—If a person feel giddy or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
languid from the use of this luxury, he should lay
himself down on his back, exposed to a current of
cool air. Should this fail of reviving him, let him
either swallow twenty or thirty drops of hartshorn,
mixed with a glass of cold water, or an ounce of
vinegar moderately diluted. When tobacco has
been received into the stomach, so as to produce
dangerous symptoms, a powerful emetic must immediately
be given, and vomiting encouraged by
copious drinks, till the poison is brought up. After
this, vinegar ought to be freely exhibited, and
lethargy prevented by the external and internal
use of stimuli. If apoplectic symptoms appear,
blooding must be had recourse to. The same rule
applies here, with regard to acids, as in the case of
opium. They should never be given till the
stomach is thoroughly liberated of its contents by
previous vomiting.</p>

<p>Accidents happen oftener with tobacco than is
commonly supposed. Severe languor, retching, and
convulsive attacks sometimes ensue from the application
of ointment, made with this plant, for the
cure of the ring-worm; and Santeuil, the celebrated
French poet, lost his life in consequence of having
unknowingly drunk a glass of wine, into which had
been put some Spanish snuff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p class="section">IV. <i>From Nitrous Oxide.</i>—Though the inhalation
of this gas is seldom attended with any risk, yet, in
very plethoric habits, there might be a determination
of blood to the head, sufficient to produce
apoplexy. If a person, therefore, becomes, after
the experiment, convulsed, stupified, and livid in
the countenance, and if these symptoms do not soon
wear away, some means must be adopted for their
removal. In general, a free exposure to fresh air,
and dashing cold water over the face, will be quite
sufficient; but if the affection is so obstinate as to
resist this plan, it will then be necessary to draw
some blood from the arm, or, what is still better,
from the jugular vein. When, in delicate subjects,
hysteria and other nervous symptoms are produced,
blooding is not necessary; all that is requisite to
be done being the application of cold water to the
brow or temples, and of hartshorn to the nostrils.
In obstinate cases, twenty or thirty drops of the
latter in a glass of water, may be administered with
advantage.</p>

<span class="smaller">PATHOLOGY OF DRUNKENNESS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The evil consequences of drinking, both in a physical
and moral point of view, seem to have been known
from the most remote antiquity. They are expressly
mentioned in Scripture; nor can there be a doubt
that the Homeric fiction of the companions of Ulysses
being turned into swine by the enchanted cup of
Circe, plainly implied the bestial degradation into
which men bring themselves by coming under the
dominion of so detestable a habit. Having mentioned
these circumstances in favour of the accuracy
of ancient knowledge, we shall simply proceed to
detail the effects of drunkenness, so far as the
medical practitioner is professionally interested in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
knowing them. The moral consequences belong
more properly to the legislator and divine, and do
not require to be here particularly considered.</p>

<p class="section">I. <i>State of the Liver.</i>—One of the most common
consequences of drunkenness is acute inflammation.
This may affect any organ, but its attacks are principally
confined to the brain, the stomach, and the
liver. It is unnecessary to enter into any detail of
its nature and treatment. These are precisely the
same as when it proceeds from any other cause.
The inflammation of drunkenness is, in a great
majority of cases, chronic; and the viscus which, in
nine cases out of ten, suffers, is the liver.</p>

<p>Liquors, from the earliest ages, have been known
to affect this organ. Probably the story of Prometheus
stealing fire from heaven and animating
clay, alluded to the effects of wine upon the human
body; and the punishment of having his liver devoured
by a vulture, may be supposed to refer to
the consequences which men draw upon themselves
by over-indulgence—this organ becoming thereby
highly diseased. Man is not the only animal so
affected. Swine who are fed on the refuse of
breweries, have their livers enlarged in the same
manner. Their other viscera become also indurated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
and their flesh so tough, that unless killed early,
they are unfit to be eaten. Some fowl-dealers in
London are said to mix gin with the food of the birds,
by which means they are fattened, and their livers
swelled to a great size. The French manage to
enlarge this organ in geese, by piercing it shortly
after the creatures are fledged.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Neither malt liquors nor wine have so rapid and
decided an effect upon the liver as ardent spirits.
Indeed, it is alleged, although I cannot go this
length, that the wine that is <i>perfectly pure</i> does not
affect the liver: and the fact of our continental
neighbours being much less troubled with hepatic
complaints than the wine-drinkers among ourselves,
gives some countenance to the allegation; for it is
well known that to suit the British market, the
vinous liquors used in this country are sophisticated
with brandy. In wine that is perfectly pure the
alcohol exists in such a state of chemical combination,
as greatly to modify its effects upon the system.
In the wine generally to be met with, much of it
exists mechanically or uncombined, and all this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
portion of spirit acts precisely in the same manner
as if separately used.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The liver is a viscus which, in confirmed topers,
never escapes; and it withstands disease better
than any other vital part, except, perhaps, the spleen.
Sometimes, by a slow chronic action, it is enlarged
to double its usual size, and totally disorganized,
and yet the person suffers comparatively little.
The disease frequently arises in tropical climates,
from warmth and other natural causes, but an
excess in spirituous liquors is more frequently the
cause than is generally imagined.</p>

<p>The consequences which follow chronic inflammation
of the liver, are very extensive. The bile, in
general, is not secreted in due quantity or quality,
consequently digestion is defective, the bowels, from
want of their usual stimulus, become torpid. The
person gets jaundiced, his skin becoming yellow, dry,
and rough, and the white of his eyes discoloured.
As the enlargement goes on, the free passage of
blood in the veins is impeded, and their extremities
throw out lymph: this accumulating, forms dropsy,
a disease with which a great proportion of drunkards
are ultimately more or less affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>The jaundice of drunkenness is not an original
disease, but merely a symptom of the one under
consideration. A very slight cause will often bring
it on; it is, consequently, not always dangerous.
Dropsy is, for the most part, also symptomatic of
diseased liver, but sometimes, more especially in
dram-drinkers, it arises from general debility of the
system. In the former case, effusion always takes
place in the cavity of the abdomen. In the latter,
there is general anasarca throughout the body,
usually coupled with more or less topical affection.
In every instance, dropsy, whether general or local,
is a very dangerous disease.</p>

<p class="section">II. <i>State of the Stomach, &amp;c.</i>—Like the liver, the
stomach is more subject to chronic than acute
inflammation. It is also apt to get indurated, from
long-continued, slow action going on within its
substance. This disease is extremely insidious,
frequently proceeding great lengths before it is
discovered. The organ is often thickened to half
an inch, or even an inch; and its different tunics
so matted together that they cannot be separated.
The pyloric orifice becomes, in many cases, contracted.
The cardiac may suffer the same disorganization,
and so may the œsophagus; but these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
are less common, and it must be admitted, more
rapidly fatal. When the stomach is much thickened,
it may sometimes be felt like a hard ball below
the left ribs. At this point there is also a dull
uneasy pain, which is augmented upon pressure.</p>

<p>Indigestion or spasm may arise from a mere imperfect
action of this organ, without any disease of
its structure; but when organic derangement takes
place, they are constant attendants. In the latter
case it is extremely difficult for any food to remain
on the stomach; it is speedily vomited. What
little is retained undergoes a painful fermentation,
which produces sickness and heartburn. There is,
at the same time, much obstinacy in the bowels,
and the body becomes emaciated.</p>

<p>This disease, though generally produced by
dissipation, originates sometimes from other causes,
and affects the soberest people. Whenever the
stomach is neglected, when acidity is allowed to
become habitual, or indigestible food too much
made use of, the foundation may be laid for slow
inflammation, terminating in scirrhus and all its bad
consequences.</p>

<p>Vomiting of bilious matter in the mornings, is a
very common circumstance among all classes of
drunkards. But there is another kind of vomiting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
much more dangerous, to which they are subject;
and that is when inflammation of the villous coat of
the stomach takes place. In such a state there is
not much acute pain, but rather a dull feeling of
uneasiness over the abdomen, attended with the
throwing up of a dark, crude matter, resembling
coffee grounds. I have seen two cases in which the
vomiting stopped suddenly, in consequence of
metastasis to the head. In these, the affection soon
proved fatal, the persons being seized with indistinctness
of vision, low delirium, and general want
of muscular power: the action of the kidneys was
also totally suspended for three days before death.
On examination, <i>post mortem</i>, there was effusion in
the ventricles of the brain, besides extensive
inflammation along the inner surface of the upper
portion of the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>Bilious complaints, which were formerly in a great
measure unknown to the common people, are now
exceedingly common among them, and proceed in a
great measure from the indulgence in ardent spirits
to which that class of society is so much addicted.</p>

<p>There is nothing more indicative of health, than
a good appetite for breakfast; but confirmed topers,
from the depraved state of their stomachs, lose all
relish for this meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Persons of this description are generally of a
costive habit of body, but a debauch, with those
who are constitutionally sober, is, for the most part,
followed by more or less diarrhœa.</p>

<p>In the latter stages of a drunkard’s life, though
he has still the relish for liquor as strongly as ever,
he no longer enjoys his former power of withstanding
it. This proceeds from general weakness of
the system, and more particularly of the stomach.
This organ gets debilitated, and soon gives way,
while the person is intoxicated much easier, and
often vomits what he had swallowed. His appetite
likewise fails; and, to restore it, he has recourse to
various bitters, which only aggravate the matter,
especially as they are in most cases taken under the
medium of ardent spirits. Bitters are often dangerous
remedies. When used moderately, and in cases
of weak digestion from natural causes, they frequently
produce the best effects; but a long continuance
of them is invariably injurious. There
is a narcotic principle residing in most bitters,
which physicians have too much overlooked. It
destroys the sensibility of the stomach, determines
to the head, and predisposes to apoplexy and palsy.
This was the effects of the famous Portland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Powder,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> so celebrated many years ago for the cure of gout;
and similar consequences will, in the long-run, follow
bitters as they are commonly administered. Persons
addicted to intemperance, have an inordinate liking
for these substances; let them be ever so nauseous,
they are swallowed greedily, especially if dissolved
in spirits. Their fondness for purl, herb-ale, and
other pernicious morning drinks, is equally striking.</p>

<p>There is nothing more characteristic of a tippler
than an indifference to tea, and beverages of a like
nature. When a woman exhibits this quality, we
may reasonably suspect her of indulging in liquor.
If drunkards partake of tea, they usually saturate
it largely with ardent spirits. The unadulterated fluid
is too weak a stimulus for their unnatural appetites.</p>

<p class="section">III. <i>State of the Brain.</i>—Inflammation of this
organ is often a consequence of intemperance. It
may follow immediately after a debauch, or it may
arise secondarily from an excess of irritation being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
applied to the body, during the stage of debility.
Even an abstraction of stimulus, as by applying too
much cold to the head, may bring it on in this latter
state.</p>

<p>Dr. Armstrong, in his lectures, speaks of a chronic
inflammation of the brain and its membranes, proceeding,
among other causes, from the free use of
strong wines and liquors. According to him, it is
much more common after, than before, forty years
of age, although he has seen several instances occurring
in young persons. The brain gets diseased,
the diameter of the vessels being diminished, while
their coats are thickened and less transparent than
usual. In some places they swell out and assume
a varicose appearance. The organ itself has no
longer the same delicate and elastic texture, becoming
either unnaturally hard, or of a morbid softness.
Slight effusions in the various cavities are apt to
take place. Under these circumstances, there is a
strong risk of apoplexy. To this structure is to be
ascribed the mental debasement, the loss of memory,
and gradual extinction of the intellectual powers.
I believe that the brains of all confirmed drunkards
exhibit more or less of the above appearances.</p>

<p class="section">IV. <i>State of the Kidneys.</i>—During intoxication
the action of the kidneys is always much increased;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
and this is a favourable circumstance, as, more than
any thing else it carries off the bad effects of drinking.
The kidney, however, in confirmed drunkards,
is apt to become permanently diseased, and secretes
its accustomed fluid with unusual activity, not only
in the moments of drunkenness, when such an
increase is useful, but at all periods, even when
the person abstains from every sort of indulgence.
The disease called diabetes is thus produced, which
consists in a morbid increase of the secretion,
accompanied with a diseased state of the texture of
the kidneys. This affection is mostly fatal.</p>

<p class="section">V. <i>State of the Bladder.</i>—Drunkenness affects
this organ in common with almost every other;
hence it is subject to paralysis, spasm, induration,
&amp;c., and to all bad consequences thence resulting—such
as pain, incontinence, and retention of urine.</p>

<p class="section">VI. <i>State of the Blood and Breath.</i>—The blood
of a professed drunkard, as already stated, differs
from that of a sober man. It is more dark, and
approaches to the character of venous. The ruddy
tint of those carbuncles which are apt to form upon
the face, is no proof to the contrary, as the blood
which supplies them is crimsoned by exposure to the
air, on the same principle as that by which the blood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
in the pulmonary arteries receives purification by
the process of breathing. The blood of a malt-liquor
drinker is not merely darker, but also
more thick and sizy than in other cases, owing, no
doubt, to the very nutritious nature of his habitual
beverage.</p>

<p>The breath of a drunkard is disgustingly bad, and
has always a spirituous odour. This is partly owing
to the state of the stomach, which communicates the
flavour of its customary contents to respiration; and
partly, also, there can be little doubt, to the absorption
of the liquor by the blood, through the medium
of the lacteals.</p>

<p class="section">VII. <i>State of the Perspiration.</i>—The perspiration
of a confirmed drunkard is as offensive as his
breath, and has often a strong spirituous odour. I
have met with two instances, the one in a Claret,
the other in a Port drinker, in which the moisture
which exuded from their bodies had a ruddy
complexion, similar to that of the wine on which
they had committed their debauch.</p>

<p class="section">VIII. <i>State of the Eyes, &amp;c.</i>—The eyes may be
affected with acute or chronic inflammation. Almost
all drunkards have the latter more or less. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
eyes are red and watery, and have an expression so
peculiar, that the cause can never be mistaken.
This, and a certain want of firmness about the lips,
which are loose, gross, and sensual, betray at once
the toper. Drunkenness impairs vision. The delicacy
of the retina is probably affected; and it is
evident, that, from long-continued inflammation, the
tunica adnata which covers the cornea must lose
its original clearness and transparency.</p>

<p>Most drunkards have a constant tenderness and
redness of the nostrils. This, I conceive, arises from
the state of the stomach and œsophagus. The same
membrane which lines them is prolonged upwards
to the nose and mouth, and carries thus far its
irritability.</p>

<p>There is no organ which so rapidly betrays the
Bacchanalian propensities of its owner as the nose.
It not only becomes red and fiery, like that of
Bardolph,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but acquires a general increase of size—displaying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
upon its surface various small pimples,
either wholly of a deep crimson hue, or tipped with
yellow, in consequence of an accumulation of viscid
matter within them. The rest of the face often
presents the same carbuncled appearances.</p>

<p>I have remarked that drunkards who have a foul,
livid, and pimpled face, are less subject to liver complaint
than those who are free from such eruptions.
In this case the determination of blood to the
surface of the body seems to prevent that fluid
from being directed so forcibly to the viscera as it
otherwise would be. The same fact is sometimes
observed in sober persons who are troubled with
hepatic affection. While there is a copious rush
upon the face or body, they are comparatively well,
but no sooner does it go in than they are annoyed
by the liver getting into disorder.</p>

<p class="section">IX. <i>State of the Skin.</i>—The skin of a drunkard,
especially if he be advanced in life, has seldom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
appearance of health. It is apt to become either
livid or jaundiced in its complexion, and feels rough
and scaly. There is a disease spoken of by Dr.
Darwin, under the title of <i>Psora Ebriorum</i>, which
is peculiar to people of this description. “Elderly
people,” says he, “who have been much addicted to
spirituous drinks, as beer, wine, or alcohol, are liable
to an eruption all over their bodies; which is attended
with very afflicting itching, and which they
probably propagate from one part of their bodies to
another with their own nails by scratching themselves.”
I have met with several cases of this
disease, which is only one of the many forms of
morbid action, which the skin is apt to assume in
drunkards.</p>

<p class="section">X. <i>State of the Hair.</i>—The hair of drunkards is
generally dry, slow of growth, and liable to come
out; they are consequently more subject to baldness
than other people. At the same time, it would be
exceedingly unjust to suspect any one, whose hair
was of this description, of indulgence in liquors, for
we frequently find in the soberest persons that the
hairs are arid, few in number, and prone to decay.
Baldness with such persons is merely a local
affection, but in drunkards it is constitutional, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
proceeds from that general defect of vital energy
which pervades their whole system.</p>

<p class="section">XI. <i>Inflammations.</i>—Drunkards are exceedingly
subject to all kinds of inflammation, both from the
direct excitement of the liquor, and from their often
remaining out in a state of intoxication, exposed to
cold and damp. Hence inflammatory affections of the
lungs, intestines, bladder, kidneys, brain, &amp;c., arising
from these sources. Rheumatism is often traced to
the neglect and exposure of a fit of drunkenness.</p>

<p class="section">XII. <i>Gout.</i>—Gout is the offspring of gluttony,
drunkenness, or sensuality, or of them all put
together. It occurs most frequently with the
wine-bibber. A very slight cause may bring it on
when hereditary predisposition exists; but in other
circumstances considerable excess will be required
before it makes its appearance. It is one of the most
afflicting consequences of intemperance, and seems
to have been known as such from an early age—mention
being made of it by Hippocrates, Aretæus,
and Galen. Among the Roman ladies gout was
very prevalent during the latter times of the empire;
and, at the present day, there are few noblemen who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
have it not to hand down to their offspring as a
portion of their heritage.</p>

<p class="section">XIII. <i>Tremors.</i>—A general tremor is an attendant
upon almost all drunkards. This proceeds from
nervous irritability. Even those who are habitually
temperate, have a quivering in their hands next
morning, if they indulge overnight in a debauch.
While it lasts, a person cannot hold any thing without
shaking, neither can he write steadily. Among
those who have long devoted themselves to the mysteries
of Silenus, this amounts to a species of palsy,
affecting the whole body, and even the lips, with a
sort of paralytic trembling. On awaking from
sleep, they frequently feel it so strongly, as to seem
in the cold fit of an ague, being neither able to walk
steadily, nor articulate distinctly. It is singular
that the very cause of this distemper should be employed
for its cure. When the confirmed drunkard
awakes with tremor, he immediately swallows a
dram: the most violent shaking is quieted by this
means. The opium-eater has recourse to the same
method: to remove the agitation produced by one
dose of opium, he takes another. This, in both cases,
is only adding fuel to the fire—the tremors coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
on at shorter intervals, and larger doses being
required for their removal.</p>

<p>Drunkards are more subject than any other class
of people to apoplexy and palsy.</p>

<p class="section">XIV. <i>Palpitation of the Heart.</i>—This is a very
distressing consequence of drunkenness, producing
difficult breathing, and such a determination to the
head as often brings on giddiness. Drunkards are
apt to feel it as they step out of bed, and the vertigo
is frequently so great as to make them stumble.
There are some sober persons who are much annoyed
by this affection. In them it may arise from
spasmodic action of the fibres of the heart, nervous
irritability, or organic disease, such as aneurism, or
angina pectoris.</p>

<p class="section">XV. <i>Hysteria.</i>—Female drunkards are very subject
to hysterical affections. There is a delicacy of
fibre in women, and a susceptibility of mind, which
make them feel more acutely than the other sex all
external influences. Hence the whole system is
often violently affected with hysterics and other
varieties of nervous weakness. These affections
are not always traced to their true cause, which is
often neither more nor less than dram-drinking.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
When a woman’s nose becomes crimsoned at the
point, her eyes somewhat red, and more watery
than before, and her lips fuller and less firm and
intellectual in their expression, we may suspect that
something wrong is going on.</p>

<p class="section">XVI. <i>Epilepsy.</i>—Drunkenness may bring on
epilepsy, or falling sickness, and may excite it into
action in those who have the disease from other
causes. Many persons cannot get slightly intoxicated
without having an epileptic or other convulsive
attack. These fits generally arise in the early stages,
before drunkenness has got to a height. If they do
not occur early, the individual will probably escape
them altogether for the time.</p>

<p class="section">XVII. <i>Sterility.</i>—This is a state to which confirmed
drunkards are very subject. The children of
such persons are, in general, neither numerous nor
healthy. From the general defect of vital power in
the parental system, they are apt to be puny and
emaciated, and more than ordinarily liable to inherit
all the diseases of those from whom they are sprung.
On this account, the chances of long life are much
diminished among the children of such parents. In
proof of this, it is only necessary to remark, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
according to the London bills of mortality, one-half
of the children born in the metropolis die before
attaining their third year; while, of the children
of the Society of Friends, a class remarkable for
sobriety and regularity of all kinds, one-half actually
attain the age of forty-seven years. Much of this
difference, doubtless, originates in the superior
degree of comfort, and correct general habits of the
Quakers, which incline them to bestow every care
in the rearing of their offspring, and put it in their
power to obtain the means of combating disease;
but the main-spring of this superior comfort and
regularity is doubtless temperance—a virtue which
this class of people possess in an eminent degree.</p>

<p class="section">XVIII. <i>Emaciation.</i>—Emaciation is peculiarly
characteristic of the spirit drinker. He wears away,
before his time, into the “lean and slippered
pantaloon” spoken of by Shakspeare in his “Stages
of Human Life.” All drunkards, however, if they
live long enough, become emaciated. The eyes get
hollow, the cheeks fall in, and wrinkles soon furrow
the countenance with the marks of age. The fat is
absorbed from every part, and the rounded plumpness
which formerly characterized the body soon
wears away. The whole form gets lank and debilitated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
There is a want of due warmth, and the hand
is usually covered with a chill clammy perspiration.</p>

<p>The occurrence of emaciation is not to be wondered
at in persons who are much addicted to ardent
spirits, for alcohol, besides being possessed of no
nutritive properties, prevents the due chymification
of the food, and consequently deteriorates the quality,
besides diminishing the quantity of chyle. The
principle of nutrition being thus affected, the person
becomes emaciated as a natural consequence.</p>

<p class="section">XIX. <i>Corpulency.</i>—Malt liquor and wine drinkers
are, for the most part, corpulent, a state of body
which rarely attends the spirit drinker, unless he be,
at the same time, a <i>bon vivant</i>. Both wines and
malt liquors are more nourishing than spirits. Under
their use, the blood becomes, as it were, enriched,
and a universal deposition of fat takes place throughout
the system. The omentum and muscles of the
belly are, in a particular manner, loaded with this
secretion; whence the abdominal protuberance so
remarkable in persons who indulge themselves in
wines and ales. As the abdomen is the part which
becomes most enlarged, so is it that which longest
retains its enlargement. It seldom parts with it,
indeed, even in the last stages, when the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
body is in a state of emaciation. There can be no
doubt that the parts which first lose their corpulency
are the lower extremities. Nothing is more common
than to see a pair of spindle shanks tottering
under the weight of an enormous corporation, to
which they seem attached more like artificial appendages,
than natural members. The next parts which
give way, are the shoulders. They fall flat, and lose
their former firmness and rotundity of organization.
After this, the whole body becomes loose, flabby,
and inelastic; and five years do as much to the constitution
as fifteen would have done under a system
of strict temperance and sobriety. The worst symptom
that can befall a corpulent man, is the decline
of his lower extremities.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> So long as they continue
firm, and correspond with the rest of the body, it is
a proof that there is still vigour remaining; but
when they gradually get attenuated, while other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
parts retain their original fulness, there can be no
sign more sure that his constitution is breaking
down, and that he will never again enjoy his wonted
strength.</p>

<p class="section">XX. <i>Premature Old Age.</i>—Drunkenness has a
dreadful effect in anticipating the effects of age. It
causes time to pace on with giant strides—chases
youth from the constitution of its victims—and
clothes them prematurely with the grey garniture
of years. How often do we see the sunken eye,
the shrivelled cheek, the feeble, tottering step, and
hoary head, in men who have scarcely entered into
the autumn of their existence. To witness this
distressing picture, we have only to walk out early
in the mornings, and see those gaunt, melancholy
shadows of mortality, betaking themselves to the gin-shops,
as to the altar of some dreadful demon, and
quaffing the poisoned cup to his honour, as the Carthagenians
propitiated the deity of their worship, by
flinging their children into the fire which burned
within his brazen image. Most of these unhappy
persons are young, or middle-aged men; and though
some drunkards attain a green old age, they are few
in number compared with those who sink untimely
into the grave ere the days of their youth have well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
passed by.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Nothing is more common than to see
a man of fifty as hoary, emaciated, and wrinkled, as
if he stood on the borders of fourscore.</p>

<p>The effect of intemperance in shortening life is
strikingly exemplified in the contrast afforded by
other classes of society to the Quakers, a set of
people of whom I must again speak favourably. It
appears from accurate calculation, that in London
only one person in forty attains the age of fourscore,
while among the Quakers, whose sobriety is proverbial,
and who have long set themselves against the
use of ardent spirits, not less than one in ten reaches
that age—a most striking difference, and one which
carries its own inference along with it.</p>

<p>It is remarked by an eminent practitioner, that
of more than a hundred men in a glass-manufactory,
three drank nothing but water, and these three appeared
to be of their proper age, while the rest who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
indulged in strong drinks seemed ten or twelve years
older than they proved to be. This is conclusive.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p class="section">XXI. <i>Ulcers.</i>—Ulcers often break out on the
bodies of drunkards. Sometimes they are fiery and
irritable, but in general they possess an indolent
character. Of whatever kind they may be, they are
always aggravated in such constitutions. A slight
cause gives rise to them; and a cut or bruise which,
in health, would have healed in a few days, frequently
degenerates into a foul sloughy sore. When
drunkards are affected with scrofula, scurvy, or any
cutaneous disease whatever, they always, <i>cæteris
paribus</i>, suffer more than other people.</p>

<p class="section">XXII. <i>Melancholy.</i>—Though drunkards over
their cups are the happiest of mankind, yet, in their
solitary hours, they are the most wretched. Gnawing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
care, heightened perhaps by remorse, preys upon
their conscience. While sober, they are distressed
both in body and mind, and fly to the bowl to drown
their misery in oblivion. Those, especially, whom
hard fate drove to this desperate remedy, feel the
pangs of low spirits with sevenfold force. The
weapon they employ to drive away care is turned
upon themselves. Every time it is used, it becomes
less capable of scaring the fiend of melancholy, and
more effectual in wounding him that uses it.</p>

<p>All drunkards are apt to become peevish and
discontented with the world. They turn enemies
to the established order of things, and, instead of
looking to themselves, absurdly blame the government
as the origin of their misfortunes.</p>

<p class="section">XXIII. <i>Madness.</i>—This terrible infliction often
proceeds from drunkenness. When there is hereditary
predisposition, indulgence in liquor is more
apt to call it into action than when there is none.
The mind and body act reciprocally upon one
another; and when the one is injured the other
must suffer more or less. In intemperance, the
structure of the brain is no longer the same as in
health; and the mind, that immortal part of man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
whose manifestations depend upon this organ,
suffers a corresponding injury.</p>

<p>Intoxication may affect the mind in two ways. A
person, after excessive indulgence in liquor, may be
seized with delirium, and run into a state of violent
outrage and madness. In this case the disease comes
suddenly on: the man is fierce and intractable, and
requires a strait jacket to keep him in order. Some
never get drunk without being insanely outrageous;
they attack, without distinction, all who come in
their way, foam at the mouth, and lose all sense of
danger. This fit either goes off in a few hours, or
degenerates into a confirmed attack of lunacy. More
generally, however, the madness of intoxication is
of another character, partaking of the nature of
idiotism, into which state the mind resolves itself,
in consequence of a long-continued falling off in the
intellectual powers.</p>

<p>Drunkenness, according to the reports of Bethlehem
Hospital, and other similar institutions for the
insane, is one of the most common causes of lunacy.
In support of this fact, it may be mentioned that of
two hundred and eighty-six lunatics now in the
Richmond Asylum, Dublin, one-half owe their madness
to drinking; and there are few but must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
witnessed the wreck of the most powerful minds, by
this destructive habit. It has a more deplorable
effect upon posterity than any other practice, for it
entails, not only bodily disease upon the innocent
offspring, but also the more afflicting diseases of the
mind. Madness of late years has been greatly on
the increase among the lower classes, and can only
be referred to the alarming progress of drunkenness,
which prevails now to a much greater extent among
the poor than ever it did at any former period.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="section">XXIV. <i>Delirium Tremens.</i>—Both the symptoms
and treatment of this affection require to be mentioned,
because, unlike the diseases already enumerated,
it invariably originates in the abuse of stimuli,
and is cured in a manner peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>Those who indulge in spirits, especially raw, are
most subject to delirium tremens, although wine,
malt liquor, opium, and even ether, may give rise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
to it, if used in moderate quantities. The sudden
cessation of drinking in a confirmed toper, or a
course of violent or long protracted intemperance
may equally occasion the disease. A man, for
instance of the former description, breaks his leg,
or is seized with some complaint, which compels him
to abandon his potations. This man in consequence
of such abstinence is attacked with delirium tremens.
In another man, it is induced by a long
course of tippling, or by a hard drinking-bout of
several days’ continuance.</p>

<p>The disease generally comes on with lassitude,
loss of appetite, and frequent exacerbations of cold.
The pulse is weak and quick, and the body covered
with a chilly moisture. The countenance is pale,
there are usually tremors of the limbs, anxiety, and
a total disrelish for the common amusements of life.
Then succeed retching, vomiting, and much oppression
at the pit of the stomach, with sometimes slimy
stools. When the person sleeps, which is but
seldom, he frequently starts in the utmost terror,
having his imagination haunted by frightful dreams.
To the first coldness, glows of heat succeed, and the
slightest renewed agitation of body or mind, sends
out a profuse perspiration. The tongue is dry and
furred. Every object appears unnatural and hideous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
There is a constant dread of being haunted by
spectres. Black or luminous bodies seem to float
before the person: he conceives that vermin and all
sorts of impure things are crawling upon him, and
is constantly endeavouring to pick them off. His
ideas are wholly confined to himself and his own
affairs, of which he entertains the most disordered
notions. He imagines that he is away from home,
forgets those who are around him, frequently abuses
his attendants, and is irritated beyond measure by
the slightest contradiction. Calculations, buildings,
and other fantastic schemes often occupy his mind;
and a belief that every person is confederated to
ruin him, is commonly entertained. Towards morning
there is often much sickness and sometimes
vomiting. This state generally lasts from four to
ten days, and goes off after a refreshing sleep; but
sometimes either from the original violence of the
disease, or from improper treatment, it proves fatal.</p>

<p>Such, in nine cases out of ten, is the character of
delirium tremens. Sometimes, however, the symptoms
vary, and instead of a weak there is a full
pulse; instead of the face being pallid, it is flushed
and the eyes fiery; instead of a cold clammy skin,
the surface is hot and dry. This state only occurs
in vigorous plethoric subjects. An habitually sober<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
man who has thoughtlessly rushed into a debauch,
is more likely to be attacked in this mariner than a
professed drunkard. Indeed, I never met with an
instance of the latter having this modification of the
disease.</p>

<p>When the patient perishes from delirium tremens
he is generally carried off in convulsions. There
is another termination which the disease sometimes
assumes: it may run into madness or confirmed
idiotism. Indeed, when it continues much beyond
the time mentioned, there is danger of the mind
becoming permanently alienated.</p>

<p>Subsultus, low delirium, very cold skin, short
disturbed sleep, contracted pupil, strabismus, rapid
intermittent pulse, and frequent vomiting, are indications
of great danger. When the patient is
affected with subsultus from which he recovers in
terror, the danger is extreme.</p>

<p>In treating delirium tremens, particular attention
must be paid to the nature of the disease,
and constitution of the patient. In the first
mentioned, and by far the most frequent variety,
blooding, which some physicians foolishly recommend,
is most pernicious. I have known more than
one instance where life was destroyed by this practice.
As there is generally much gastric irritation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
as is indicated by the foul tongue, black and viscid
evacuations, and irritable state of the stomach, I commence
the treatment by administering a smart dose
of calomel. As soon as this has operated, I direct
tepid water strongly impregnated with salt, to be
dashed over the body, and the patient immediately
thereafter to be well dried and put to bed. I then
administer laudanum in doses of from forty to sixty
drops, according to circumstances, combining with
each dose from six to twelve grains of the carbonate
of ammonia: this I repeat every now and
then till sleep is procured. It may sometimes be
necessary to give such doses every two hours, or
even every hour, for twelve or twenty successive
hours, before the effect is produced. The black
drop in doses proportioned to its strength, which
is more than three times that of laudanum, may
be used as a substitute for the latter; the acetate
or muriate of morphia, in doses of a quarter or
half a grain, is also a good medicine, having less
tendency to produce stupor or headach than laudanum,
and therefore preferable in cases where the
patient is of a plethoric habit of body. It must be
admitted, however, that their effects are less to be
depended upon than those of laudanum, which, in
all common cases will, I believe, be found the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
remedy. The great object of the treatment is to
soothe the apprehensions of the patient, and procure
him rest. So soon as a sound sleep takes
place there is generally a crisis, and the disease
begins to give way; but till this occurs it is impossible
to arrest its progress and effect a cure. A
moderate quantity of wine will be necessary, especially
if he has been a confirmed drinker, and labours
under much weakness. Perhaps the best way of
administering wine is along with the laudanum, the
latter being dropped into the wine. Where wine
cannot be had, porter may be advantageously given
in combination with laudanum. The principal
means, indeed, after the first purging, are opium,
wine, ammonia, and tepid effusion: the latter may
be tried two, three, or four times in the twenty-four
hours, as occasion requires. The mind is, at the same
time, to be soothed in the gentlest manner, the
whimsical ideas of the patient to be humoured, and
his fancies indulged as far as possible. All kinds of
restraint or contradiction are most hurtful. Some
recommend blisters to the head, but these are, in
every case, injurious. So soon as all the symptoms
of the disease have disappeared some purgative
should be administered, but during its progress we
must rely almost wholly upon stimulants. To cure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
by means of stimuli, a complaint which arose from
an over-indulgence in such agents, is apparently
paradoxical; but experience confirms the propriety
of the practice where, <i>a priori</i>, we might expect the
contrary.</p>

<p>In the second variety of the disease, the same
objections do not apply to blood-letting as in the
first, but even there, great caution is necessary,
especially if the disease has gone on for any length
of time, if the pulse is quick and feeble or the
tongue foul. At first, general blooding will often
have an excellent effect, but should we not be called
till after this stage it will prove a hazardous
experiment. Local blooding will then sometimes
be serviceable where general blooding could not be
safely attempted. The patient should be purged
well with calomel, have his head shaved, and kept
cool with wet cloths, and sinapisms applied to his
feet. When the bowels are well evacuated, and no
symptoms of coma exist, opiates must be given as in
the first variety, but in smaller and less frequently
repeated doses.</p>

<p>Much yet remains to be known with regard to
the pathology of delirium tremens. I believe that
physicians have committed a dangerous error, in
considering these two varieties as modifications of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
the same disease. In my opinion they are distinct
affections and ought to be known under different
names. This cannot be better shown than in the
conflicting opinions with regard to the real nature
of the disease. Dr. Clutterbuck, having apparently
the second variety in his eye, conceives that delirium
tremens arises from congestion or inflammation
of the brain; while Dr. Ryan, referring to the first,
considers it a nervous affection, originating in that
species of excitement often accompanying debility.
It is very evident, that such different conditions
require different curative means. The genuine
delirium tremens is that described under the first
variety, and I agree with Dr. Ryan in the view he
takes of the character of this singular disease.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span>—Such are the principal
diseases brought on by drunkenness. There are
still several others which have not been enumerated—nor
is there any affection incident to either the
body or mind which the vice does not aggravate
into double activity. The number of persons who
die in consequence of complaints so produced, is
much greater than unprofessional people imagine.
This fact is well known to medical men, who are
aware that many of the cases they are called upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
to attend, originate in liquor, although very often
the circumstance is totally unknown either to the
patient or his friends. This is particularly the case
with regard to affections of the liver, stomach, and
other viscera concerned in digestion. Dr. Willan,
in his reports of the diseases of London, states his
conviction that considerably more than one-eighth
of all the deaths which take place in persons above
twenty years old, happen prematurely through excess
in drinking spirits. Nor are the moral consequences
less striking: Mr. Poynter, for three years
Under-Sheriff of London and Westminster, made
the following declaration before a Committee of the
House of Commons:—“I have long been in the
habit of hearing criminals refer all their misery to
drinking, so that I now almost cease to ask them
the cause of their ruin. This evil lies at the root
of all other evils of this city and elsewhere. Nearly
all the convicts for murder with whom I have conversed,
have admitted themselves to have been under
the influence of liquor at the time of the act.” “By
due observation for nearly twenty years,” says the
great Judge Hales, “I have found that if the murders
and manslaughters, the burglaries and robberies,
and riots and tumults, the adulteries, fornications,
rapes, and other great enormities, that have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
happened in that time, were divided into five parts,
four of them have been the issues and product of
excessive drinking—of tavern and ale-house meetings.”
According to the <i>Caledonian Mercury</i> of
October 26, 1829, no fewer than ninety males,
and one hundred and thirty <i>females</i>, in a state of
intoxication, were brought to the different police
watchhouses of Edinburgh, in the course of the
previous week—being the greatest number for
many years. Nor is Glasgow, in this respect, a
whit better than Edinburgh. On March 1, 1830,
of forty-five cases brought before the police magistrate
in Glasgow, forty were for drunkenness; and
it is correctly ascertained that more than nine thousand
cases of drunkenness are annually brought
before the police, from this city and suburbs—a
frightful picture of vice. In the ingenious Introductory
Essay attached to the Rev. Dr. Beecher’s
Sermons on Intemperance, the following passage
occurs, and I think, instead of exaggerating it rather
underrates the number of drunkards in the quarter
alluded to. “Supposing that one-half of the eighteen
hundred licensed houses for the sale of spirits which
are in that city, send forth each a drunken man,
every day, there are, in Glasgow, nine hundred
drunken men, day after day, spreading around them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
beggary, and wretchedness, and crime!” Had the
author given to each licensed house, one drunkard
on an average, I do not think he would have overstepped
the bounds of truth. As it is, what a picture
of demoralization and wretchedness does it not
exhibit!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="smaller">SLEEP OF DRUNKARDS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>To enter at large upon the subject of sleep would
require a volume. At present I shall only consider
it so far as it is modified by drunkenness.</p>

<p>The drunkard seldom knows the delicious and
refreshing slumbers of the temperate man. He is
restless, and tosses in bed for an hour or two before
falling asleep. Even then, his rest is not comfortable.
He awakes frequently during night, and each
time his mouth is dry, his skin parched, and his
head, for the most part, painful and throbbing.
These symptoms, from the irritable state of his constitution,
occur even when he goes soberly to bed;
but if he lie down heated with liquor, he feels them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
with double force. Most persons who fall asleep
in a state of intoxication, have much headach,
exhaustion, and general fever, on awaking. Some
constitutions are lulled to rest by liquors, and
others rendered excessively restless; but the first
are no gainers by the difference, as they suffer
abundantly afterwards. Phlegmatic drunkards drop
into slumber more readily than the others: their
sleep is, in reality, a sort of apoplectic stupor.</p>

<p class="section">I. <i>Dreams.</i>—Dreams may be readily supposed to
be common, from the deranged manifestations of
the stomach and brain which occur in intoxication.
They are usually of a painful nature, and leave a
gloomy impression upon the mind. In general,
they are less palpable to the understanding than
those which occur in soberness. They come like
painful grotesque conceptions across the imagination;
and though this faculty can embody nothing
into shape, meaning, or consistence, it is yet haunted
with melancholy ideas. These visions depend much
on the mental constitution of the person, and are
modified by his habitual tone of thinking. It is,
however, to be remarked, that while the waking
thoughts of the drunkard are full of sprightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
images, those of his sleep are usually tinged with a
shade of perplexing melancholy.</p>

<p class="section">II. <i>Nightmare.</i>—Drunkards are more afflicted
than other people with this disorder, in so far as
they are equally subject to all the ordinary causes,
and liable to others, from which sober people are
exempted. Intoxication is fertile in producing
reveries and dreams, those playthings of the fancy;
and it may also give rise to such a distortion of
idea, as to call up incubus, and all its frightful
accompaniments.</p>

<p class="section">III. <i>Sleep-walking.</i>—Somnambulism is another
affection to which drunkards are more liable than
their neighbours. I apprehend that the slumber is
never profound when this takes place, and that, in
drunkenness in particular, it may occur in a state
of very imperfect sleep. Drunkards, even when
consciousness is not quite abolished, frequently leave
their beds and walk about the room. They know
perfectly well what they are about, and recollect it
afterwards, but if questioned, either at the moment
or at any future period, they are totally unable to
give any reason for their conduct. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
after getting up, they stand a little time and endeavour
to account for rising, then go again deliberately
to bed. There is often, in the behaviour of
these individuals, a strange mixture of folly and
rationality. Persons half tipsy have been known to
arise and go out of doors in their night-dress, being
all the while sensible of what they were doing, and
aware of its absurdity. The drunken somnambulism
has not always this character. Sometimes the
reflecting faculties are so absorbed in slumber, that
the person has no consciousness of what he does.
From drinking, the affection is always more dangerous
than from any other cause, as the muscles
have no longer their former strength, and are unable
to support the person in his hazardous expeditions.
If he gets upon a house-top, he does not balance
himself properly, from giddiness; he is consequently
liable to falls and accidents of every kind. It is considered,
with justice, dangerous to awaken a sleepwalker.
In a drunken fit, there is less risk than
under other circumstances, the mind being so far
confused by intoxication, as to be, in some measure,
insensible to the shock.</p>

<p class="section">IV. <i>Sleep-talking.</i>—For the same reason that
drunkards are peculiarly prone to somnambulism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
are they subject to sleep-talking, which is merely a
modification of the other. The imagination, being
vehemently excited by the drunken dream, embodies
itself often in speech, which however is, in almost
every case, extremely incoherent, and wants the
rationality sometimes possessed by the conversation
of sleep-talkers under other circumstances.</p>

<span class="smaller">SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF DRUNKARDS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Whether such a quantity of hydrogen may accumulate
in the bodies of drunkards as to sustain combustion,
is not easy to determine. This subject is,
indeed, one which has never been satisfactorily investigated;
and notwithstanding the cases brought
forward in support of the doctrine, the general
opinion seems to be, that the whole is fable, or at
least so much involved in obscurity as to afford no
just grounds for belief. The principal information
on this point, is in the <i>Journal de Physique</i>, in an
article by Pierre-Aimé Lair, a copy of which was
published in the sixth volume of the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i>, by Mr. Alexander Tilloch. A number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
of cases are there given: and it is not a little singular
that the whole of them are those of women in
advanced life. When we consider that writers like
Vicq d’Azyr, Le Cat, Maffei, Jacobæus, Rolli,
Bianchini, and Mason Good, have given their testimony
in support of such facts, it requires some effort
to believe them unfounded in truth. At the same
time, in perusing the cases themselves, it is difficult
to divest the mind of an idea that some misstatement
or other exists, either as to their alleged cause or
their actual nature—and that their relaters have been
led into an unintentional misrepresentation. The
most curious fact connected with this subject is, that
the combustion appears seldom to be sufficiently
strong to inflame combustible substances with which
it comes in contact, such as woollen or cotton, while
it destroys the body, which in other circumstances
is hardly combustible at all.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Sometimes the body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
is consumed by an open flame flickering over it—at
other times there is merely a smothered heat or fire,
without any visible flame. It is farther alleged that
water, instead of allaying, aggravates the combustion.
This species of burning, indeed, is perfectly
<i>sui generis</i>, and bears no resemblance to any species
of combustion with which we are acquainted. In
most cases it breaks out spontaneously, although it
may be occasioned by a candle, a fire, or a stroke of
lightning; but in every case it is wholly peculiar to
itself. M. Foderé remarks, that hydrogen gas is
developed in certain cases of disease, even in the
living body; and he seems inclined to join with M.
Mere in attributing what is called spontaneous
combustion to the united action of hydrogen and
electricity in the first instance, favoured by the
accumulation of animal oil, and the impregnation of
spirituous liquors. In the present state of our knowledge,
it is needless to hazard any conjectures upon
this mysterious subject. The best way is to give
a case or two, and let the reader judge for himself.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Case of Mary Clues.</span>—“This woman, aged
fifty, was much addicted to intoxication. Her propensity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
to this vice had increased after the death of
her husband, which happened a year and a half before:
for about a year, scarcely a day had passed in
the course of which she did not drink at least half
a pint of rum or aniseed water. Her health gradually
declined, and about the beginning of February,
she was attacked by the jaundice and confined to
her bed. Though she was incapable of much action,
and not in a condition to work, she still continued
her old habit of drinking every day, and smoking a
pipe of tobacco. The bed in which she lay stood
parallel to the chimney of the apartment, at the
distance from it of about three feet. On Saturday
morning, the 1st of March, she fell on the floor,
and her extreme weakness having prevented her
from getting up, she remained in that state till some
one entered and put her to bed. The following
night she wished to be left alone: a woman quitted
her at half-past eleven, and, according to custom,
shut the door and locked it. She had put on the
fire two large pieces of coal, and placed a light in a
candlestick on a chair at the head of the bed. At
half-past five in the morning, smoke was seen issuing
through the window, and the door being speedily
broke open, some flames which were in the room
were soon extinguished. Between the bed and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
chimney were found the remains of the unfortunate
Clues; one leg and a thigh were still entire, but
there remained nothing of the skin, the muscles,
and the viscera. The bones of the cranium, the
breast, the spine, and the upper extremities were
entirely calcined, and covered with a whitish efflorescence.
The people were much surprised that the
furniture had sustained so little injury. The side
of the bed which was next the chimney had suffered
most; the wood of it was slightly burned, but the
feather-bed, the clothes, and covering were safe.
I entered the apartment about two hours after it
had been opened, and observed that the walls and
every thing in it were blackened; that it was filled
with a very disagreeable vapour; but that nothing
except the body exhibited any strong traces of
fire.”</p>

</div>

<p>This case first appeared in the <i>Annual Register</i>
for 1773, and is a fair specimen of the cases collected
in the <i>Journal de Physique</i>. There is no evidence
that the combustion was spontaneous, as it may have
been occasioned either by lightning, or by contact
with the fire. The only circumstance which
militates against the latter supposition, is the very
trifling degree of burning that was found in the
apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Case of Grace Pitt.</span>—“Grace Pitt, the wife of
a fishmonger in the parish of St. Clement, Ipswich,
aged about sixty, had contracted a habit, which
she continued for several years, of coming down
every night from her bed-room, half dressed, to
smoke a pipe. On the night of the 9th of April,
1744, she got up from her bed as usual. Her
daughter, who slept with her, did not perceive she
was absent till next morning when she awoke, soon
after which she put on her clothes, and going down
into the kitchen, found her mother stretched out on
the right side, with her head near the grate; the
body extended on the hearth, with the legs on the
floor, which was of deal, having the appearance of
a log of wood, consumed by a fire without apparent
flame. On beholding this spectacle, the girl ran
in great haste and poured over her mother’s body
some water contained in two large vessels in order
to extinguish the fire; while the fœtid odour and
smoke which exhaled from the body, almost suffocated
some of the neighbours who had hastened
to the girl’s assistance. The trunk was in some
measure incinerated, and resembled a heap of coals
covered with white ashes. The head, the arms, the
legs, and the thighs, had also participated in the
burning. This woman, it is said, had drunk a large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
quantity of spirituous liquors in consequence of being
overjoyed to hear that one of her daughters had
returned from Gibraltar. There was no fire in the
grate, and the candle had burned entirely out in the
socket of the candlestick, which was close to her.
Besides, there were found near the consumed body,
the clothes of a child and a paper screen, which had
sustained no injury by the fire. The dress of this
woman consisted of a cotton gown.”</p>

</div>

<p>This case is to be found in the <i>Transactions of
the Royal Society of London</i>, and is one of the
most decided, and least equivocal instances of this
species of combustion to be met with. It was mentioned
at the time in all the journals, and was the
subject of much speculation and remark. The
reality of its occurrence was attested by many witnesses,
and three several accounts of it, by different
hands, all nearly coincide.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Case of Don Gio Maria Bertholi.</span>—“Having
spent the day in travelling about the country,
he arrived in the evening at the house of his brother-in-law.
He immediately requested to be shown to
his destined apartment, where he had a handkerchief
placed between his shirt and shoulders; and, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
left alone betook himself to his devotions. A few
minutes had scarcely elapsed when an extraordinary
noise was heard in the chamber, and the cries of
the unfortunate man were particularly distinguished:
the people of the house, hastily entering the room,
found him extended on the floor, and surrounded
by a light flame, which receded (<i>à mesure</i>) as they
approached, and finally vanished. On the following
morning, the patient was examined by Mr.
Battlaglia, who found the integuments of the right
arm almost entirely detached, and pendant from the
flesh; from the shoulders to the thighs, the integuments
were equally injured; and on the right hand,
the part most injured, mortification had already
commenced, which, notwithstanding immediate
scarification, rapidly extended itself. The patient
complained of burning thirst, was horribly convulsed,
and was exhausted by continual vomiting, accompanied
by fever and delirium. On the fourth day,
after two hours of comatose insensibility, he expired.
During the whole period of his sufferings, it was
impossible to trace any symptomatic affection. A
short time previous to his death, M. Battlaglia
observed with astonishment, that putrefaction had
made so much progress, the body already exhaled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
an insufferable odour; worms crawled from it on
the bed, and the nails had become detached from
the left hand.</p>

<p>“The account given by the unhappy patient was,
that he felt a stroke like the blow of a cudgel on
the right hand, and at the same time he saw a
lambent flame attach itself to his shirt, which was
immediately reduced to ashes, his wristbands, at
the same time being utterly untouched. The
handkerchief which, as before-mentioned, was placed
between his shoulders and his shirt, was entire, and
free from any trace of burning; his breeches were
equally uninjured, but though not a hair of his head
was burned, his coif was totally consumed. The
weather on the night of the accident, was calm, and
the air very pure; no empyreumatic or bituminous
odour was perceived in the room, which was also
free from smoke; there was no vestige of fire,
except that the lamp which had been full of oil, was
found dry, and the wick reduced to a cinder.”</p>

</div>

<p>This case is from the work of Foderé, and is
given as abridged by Paris and Fonblanque, in their
excellent treatise on Medical Jurisprudence. It
occurred in 1776, and is one of the best authenticated
to be met with. I am not aware that the subject
of it was a drunkard; if he were not, and if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
facts be really true, we must conclude that spontaneous
combustion may occur in sober persons as
well as in the dissipated.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Case of Madame Millet.</span>—“Having,” says
Le Cat, “spent several months at Rheims, in the
years 1724 and 1725, I lodged at the house of Sieur
Millet, whose wife got intoxicated every day. The
domestic economy of the family was managed by a
pretty young girl, which I must not omit to remark,
in order that all the circumstances which accompanied
the fact I am about to relate, may be better
understood. This woman was found consumed on
the 10th of February, 1725, at the distance of a
foot and a half from the hearth in her kitchen. A
part of the head only, with a portion of the lower
extremities, and a few of the vertebræ, had escaped
combustion. A foot and a half of the flooring under
the body had been consumed, but a kneading trough
and a powdering tub, which were very near the
body, sustained no injury. M. Chriteen, a surgeon,
examined the remains of the body with every judicial
formality. Jean Millet, the husband, being interrogated
by the judges who instituted the inquiry
into the affair, declared, that about eight in the
evening, on the 9th of February, he had retired to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
rest with his wife, who not being able to sleep, went
into the kitchen, where he thought she was warming
herself; that, having fallen asleep, he was awakened
about two o’clock by an infectious odour, and that,
having run to the kitchen, he found the remains of
his wife in the state described in the report of the
physicians and surgeons. The judges, having no
suspicion of the real cause of this event, prosecuted
the affair with the utmost diligence. It was very
unfortunate for Millet that he had a handsome
servant-maid, for neither his probity nor innocence
were able to save him from the suspicion of having
got rid of his wife by a concerted plot, and of having
arranged the rest of the circumstances in such a
manner as to give it the appearance of an accident.
He experienced, therefore, the whole severity of the
law; and though, by an appeal to a superior and
very enlightened court, which discovered the cause
of the combustion, he came off victorious, he suffered
so much from uneasiness of mind, that he was
obliged to pass the remainder of his days in an
hospital.”</p>

</div>

<p>The above case has a peculiar importance attached
to it, for it shows that, in consequence of combustion,
possibly spontaneous, persons have been accused of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
murder. Foderé, in his work, alludes to several
cases of this kind.</p>

<p>Some chemists have attempted to account for this
kind of combustion, by the formation of phosphuretted
hydrogen in the body. This gas, as is well
known, inflames on exposure to the air; nor can
there be a doubt that if a sufficient quantity were
generated, the body might be easily enough consumed.
If such an accumulation can be proved ever
to take place, there is an end to conjecture; and we
have before us a cause sufficiently potent to account
for the burning. Altogether I am inclined to think,
that although most of the related cases rest on vague
report, and are unsupported by such proofs as would
warrant us in placing much reliance upon them, yet
sufficient evidence nevertheless exists, to show that
such a phenomenon as spontaneous combustion has
actually taken place, although doubtless the number
of cases has been much exaggerated. Dr. Mason
Good, justly observes, “There may be some difficulty
in giving credit to so marvellous a diathesis:
yet, examples of its existence, and of its leading to
a migratory and fatal combustion are so numerous,
and so well authenticated, and press upon us from
so many different countries and eras, that it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
be absurd to withhold our assent.” “It can no
longer be doubted,” says Dr. Gordon Smith, “that
persons have retired to their chambers in the usual
manner, and in place of the individual, a few cinders,
and perhaps part of his bones, were found.” Inflammable
eructations are said to occur occasionally
in northern latitudes, when the body has been
exposed to intense cold after excessive indulgence
in spirituous liquors; and the case of a Bohemian
peasant is narrated, who lost his life in consequence
of a column of ignited inflammable air issuing from
his mouth, and baffling extinction. This case, as
well as others of the same kind, is alleged to have
arisen from phosphuretted hydrogen, generated by
some chemical combination of alcohol and animal
substances in the stomach. What truth there may
be in these relations I do not pretend to say. They
wear unquestionably the aspect of a fiction; and are,
notwithstanding, repeated from so many quarters,
that it is nearly as difficult to doubt them altogether
as to give them our entire belief. There is one
thing, however, which may be safely denied; and
that is the fact of drunkards having been blown up
in consequence of their breath or eructations catching
fire from the application of alighted candle. These
tales are principally of American extraction; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
seem elaborated by that propensity for the marvellous
for which our transatlantic brethren have, of
late years, been distinguished.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, this subject is extremely obscure,
and has never been satisfactorily treated by any
writer. Sufficient evidence appears to me to exist
in support of the occurrence, but any information
as to the remote or proximate cause of this singular
malady, is as yet exceedingly defective and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In a memoir lately read before the Académie des
Sciences, the following are stated to be the chief circumstances
connected with spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p>“1. The greater part of the persons who have
fallen victims to it, have made an immoderate use
of alcoholic liquors. 2. The combustion is almost
always general, but sometimes is only partial. 3.
It is much rarer among men than among women,
and they are principally old women. There is but
one case of the combustion of a girl seventeen years
of age, and that was only partial. 4. The body and
the viscera are invariably burnt, while the feet, the
hands, and the top of the skull almost always escape
combustion. 5. Although it requires several fagots
to burn a common corpse, incineration takes place
in these spontaneous combustions without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
effect on the most combustible matters in the neighbourhood.
In an extraordinary instance of a double
combustion operating upon two persons in one room,
neither the apartment nor the furniture was burnt.
6. It has not been at all proved that the presence
of an inflamed body is necessary to develop
spontaneous human combustions. 7. Water, so far
from extinguishing the flame, seems to give it more
activity; and when the flame has disappeared,
secret combustion goes on. 8. Spontaneous combustions
are more frequent in winter than in summer.
9. General combustions are not susceptible of cure,
only partial. 10. Those who undergo spontaneous
combustion are the prey of a very strong internal
heat. 11. The combustion bursts out all at once,
and consumes the body in a few hours. 12. The
parts of the body not attacked are struck with mortification.
13. In persons who have been attacked
with spontaneous combustion, a putrid degeneracy
takes place which soon leads to gangrene.”</p>

<p>In this singular malady medicine is of no avail.
The combustion is kept up by causes apparently
beyond the reach of remedy, and in almost every
case, life is extinct before the phenomenon is perceived.</p>

<p>Not only does the drunkard draw down upon himself
many diseases, both of body and mind, but if,
in his intoxication, he commit any crime or misdemeanour,
he becomes, like other subjects, amenable
to the pains of law. In this respect, indeed, he is
worse off than sober persons, for drunkenness far
from palliating, is held to aggravate every offence;
the law does not regard it as any extenuation of
crime. “A drunkard,” says Sir Edward Coke,
“who is <i>voluntarius demon</i>, hath no privilege
thereby; but what hurt or ill soever he doth, his
drunkenness doth aggravate it.” In the case of the
King <i>versus</i> Maclauchlin, March, 1737, the plea of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
drunkenness, set up in mitigation of punishment, was
not allowed by the court. Sir George Mackenzie
says he never found it sustained, and that in
a case of murder it was repelled—Spott <i>versus</i>
Douglas, 1667. Sir Matthew Hales, c. 4, is clear
against the validity of the defence, and all agree
that “<i>levis et modica ebrietas non excusat nec minuit
delictum</i>.” It is a maxim in legal practice, that
“those who presume to commit crimes when drunk,
must submit to punishment when sober.” This
state of the law is not peculiar to modern times.
In ancient Greece it was decreed by Pittacus, that
“he who committed a crime when intoxicated,
should receive a double punishment,” <i>viz.</i> one for
the crime itself, and the other for the ebriety which
prompted him to commit it. The Athenians not
only punished offences done in drunkenness with
increased severity, but, by an enactment of Solon,
inebriation in a magistrate was made capital. The
Roman law was, in some measure, an exception,
and admitted ebriety as a plea for any misdeeds
committed under its influence: <i>per vinum delapsis
capitalis pœna remittitur</i>. Notwithstanding this
tenderness to offences by drunkards, the Romans,
at one period, were inconsistent enough to punish
the vice itself with death, if found occurring in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
woman. By two acts passed in the reign of James
I., drunkenness was punishable with fine, and, failing
payment, with sitting publicly for six hours in
the stocks; 4 Jac. I. c. 5, and 21 Jac. I. c. 7. By
the first of these acts, Justices of the Peace may
proceed against drunkards at the Sessions, by way
of indictment; and this act remained in operation
till the 10th of October, 1828, at which time, by
the act of the 9 Geo. IV. c. 61, § 35, the law for
the suppression of drunkenness was repealed, without
providing any punishment for offenders in this
respect. Previous to this period, the ecclesiastical
courts could take cognizance of the offence, and
punish it accordingly. As the law stands at present,
therefore, drunkenness, <i>per se</i>, is not punishable, but
acts of violence committed under its influence are
held to be aggravated rather than otherwise; nor
can the person bring it forward as an extenuation
of any folly or misdemeanour which he may chance
to commit. In proof of this, it may be stated, that
a bond signed in a fit of intoxication, holds in law,
and is perfectly binding, unless it can be shown that
the person who signed it was inebriated by the
collusion or contrivance of those to whom the bond
was given. A judge or magistrate found drunk
<i>upon the bench</i>, is liable to removal from his office;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and decisions pronounced by him in that state are
held to be null and void. Such persons cannot,
while acting <i>ex officio</i>, claim the benefit of the
repeal in the ancient law—their offence being in
itself an outrage on justice, and, therefore, a misdemeanour.
Even in blasphemy, uttered in a state of
ebriety, the defence goes for nothing, as is manifest
from the following case, given in Maclaurin’s
Arguments and Decisions, p. 731.</p>

<p>“Nov. 22, 1697. Patrick Kinninmouth, of that Ilk,
was brought to trial for blasphemy and adultery.
The last charge was passed from. The indictment
alleged, He had affirmed Christ was a bastard, and
that he had said, ‘If any woman had God on one
side, and Christ on the other, he would stow [cut]
the lugs [ears] out of her head in spite of them
both.’ He pleaded chiefly that he was drunk or
mad when he uttered these expressions, if he did
utter them. The court found the libel relevant to
infer the pains libelled, <i>i. e.</i> death; and found the
defence, That the pannel was furious or distracted
in his wits relevant; but repelled the allegeance
of fury or distraction arising <i>from drunkenness</i>.”</p>

<p>It thus appears that the laws both of Scotland
and England agree in considering drunkenness no
palliation of crime, but rather the reverse; and it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
well that it is so, seeing that ebriety could be easily
counterfeited, and made a cloak for the commission
of atrocious offences. By the laws, drunkenness is
looked upon as criminal, and this being the case,
they could not consistently allow one crime to
mitigate the penalties due to another.</p>

<p>There is only one case where drunkenness can
ever be alleged in mitigation of punishment—that
is, where it has induced “a state of mind perfectly
akin to insanity.” It is, in fact, one of the common
causes of that disease. The partition line between
intoxication and insanity, may hence become a subject
of discussion.</p>

<p>“William M’Donough was indicted and tried for
the murder of his wife, before the Supreme Court of
the State of Massachusetts, in November, 1817. It
appeared in testimony, that several years previous
he had received a severe injury of the head; that
although relieved of this, yet its effects were such
as occasionally to render him insane. At these
periods he complained greatly of his head. The
use of spirituous liquors immediately induced a
return of the paroxysms, and in one of them, thus
induced, he murdered his wife. He was with great
propriety found guilty. The <i>voluntary use</i> of a
stimulus which, he was fully aware, would disorder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
his mind, fully placed him under the power of the
law.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>“In the State of New York, we have a statute
which places the property of habitual drunkards
under the care of the chancellor, in the same manner
as that of lunatics. The overseers of the poor in
each town may, when they discover a person to be
an habitual drunkard, apply to the chancellor for
the exercise of his power and jurisdiction. And in
certain cases, when the person considers himself
aggrieved, it may be investigated by six freeholders,
whether he is actually what he is described to be,
and their declaration is, <i>primâ facie</i>, evidence of the
fact.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> [This act was passed March 16, 1821.]</p>

<p>“In Rydgway <i>v.</i> Darwin, Lord Eldon cites a
case where a commission of lunacy was supported
against a person, who, when sober, was a very
sensible man, but being in a constant state of
intoxication, he was incapable of managing his
property.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">METHOD OF CURING THE HABIT OF DRUNKENNESS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>To remove the habit of drunkenness from any one
in whom it has been long established, is a task of
peculiar difficulty. We have not only to contend
against the cravings of the body, but against those
of the mind; and in struggling with both, we are,
in reality, carrying on a combat with nature herself.
The system no longer performs its functions in the
usual manner; and to restore these functions to
their previous tone of action, is more difficult than
it would be to give the man action altogether the
reverse of nature and of health.</p>

<p>The first step to be adopted, is the discontinuance
of all liquors or substances which have the power of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
intoxicating. The only question is—should they be
dropped at once, or by degrees? Dr. Trotter, in
his Essay on Drunkenness, has entered into a long
train of argument, to prove that, in all cases, they
ought to be given up <i>instanter</i>. He contends, that,
being in themselves injurious, their sudden discontinuance
cannot possibly be attended with harm.
But his reasonings on this point, though ingenious
are not conclusive. A dark unwholesome dungeon
is a bad thing, but it has been remarked, that those
who have been long confined to such a place, have
become sick if suddenly exposed to the light and
pure air, on recovering their liberty: had this been
done by degrees, no evil effects would have ensued.
A removal from an unhealthy climate (to which
years had habituated a man) to a healthy one, has
sometimes been attended with similar consequences.
Even old ulcers cannot always be quickly healed up
with safety. Inebriation becomes, as it were, a
second nature, and is not to be rapidly changed with
impunity, more than other natures. Spurzheim<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
advances the same opinion. “Drunkards,” says he,
“cannot leave off their bad habits suddenly, without
injuring their health.” Dr. Darwin speaks in like
terms of the injurious effects of too sudden a change;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
and for these, and other reasons about to be detailed,
I am disposed, upon the whole, to coincide with them.</p>

<p>If we consider attentively the system of man, we
will be satisfied that it accommodates itself to various
states of action. It will perform a healthy action,
of which there is only one state, or a diseased
action, of which there are a hundred. The former
is uniform, and homogeneous. It may be raised or
lowered, according to the state of the circulation,
but its nature is ever the same: when that changes—when
it assumes new characters—it is no longer
the action of health, but of disease. The latter
may be multiplied to infinity, and varies with a
thousand circumstances; such as the organ which is
affected, and the substance which is taken. Now,
drunkenness in the long run, is one of those diseased
actions. The system no longer acts with its
original purity: it is operated upon by a fictitious
excitement, and, in the course of time, assumes a
state quite foreign to its original constitution—an
action which, however unhealthy, becomes, ultimately,
in some measure, natural. When we use
opium for a long time, we cannot immediately get
rid of it, because it has given rise to a false action
in the system—which would suffer a sudden disorder
if deprived of its accustomed stimulus. To illustrate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
this, it may be mentioned, that when Abbas
the Great published an edict to prohibit the use of
coquenar, (the juice of boiled poppies,) on account
of its dismal effects on the constitution, a great
mortality followed, which was only stopped at last
by restoring the use of the prohibited beverage.
Disease, under such circumstances, triumphs over
health, and has established so strong a hold upon the
body, that it is dislodged with difficulty by its lawful
possessor. When we wish to get rid of opium,
or any other narcotic to which we are accustomed,
we must do so by degrees, and let the healthy
action gradually expel the diseased one. Place
spirits or wine in the situation of opium, and the
results will be the same. For these reasons, I am
inclined to think, that, in many cases at least, it
would be improper and dangerous to remove intoxicating
liquors all at once from the drunkard. Such
a proceeding seems at variance with the established
actions of the human body, and as injudicious as
unphilosophical.</p>

<p>I do not, however, mean to say, that there are no
cases in which it would be necessary to drop liquors
all at once. When much bodily vigour remains—when
the morning cravings for the bottle are
not irresistible, nor the appetite altogether broken,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the person should give over his bad habits instantly.
This is a state of incipient drunkenness. He
has not yet acquired the constitution of a confirmed
sot, and the sooner he ceases the better.
The immediate abandonment of drinking may also,
in general, take place when there is any organic
disease, such as enlarged liver, dropsy, or scirrhus
stomach. Under these circumstances, the sacrifice
is much less than at a previous period, as the frame
has, in a great measure, lost its power of withstanding
liquors, and the relish for them is also considerably
lessened. But even then, the sudden deprivation
of the accustomed stimulus has been known to
produce dangerous exhaustion; and it has been
found necessary to give it again, though in more
moderate quantities. Those drunkards who have
no particular disease, unless a tremor and loss of
appetite be so denominated, require to be deprived
of the bottle by degrees. Their system would be
apt to fall into a state of torpor if it were suddenly
taken away, and various mental diseases, such as
melancholy, madness, and delirium tremens, might
even be the result. With such persons, however,
it must be acknowledged that there is very great
difficulty in getting their potations diminished.
Few have fortitude to submit to any reduction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
There is, as the period of the accustomed indulgence
arrives, an oppression and faintness at the <i>præcordia</i>,
which human nature can scarcely endure, together
with a gnawing desire, infinitely more insatiable
than the longings of a pregnant woman.</p>

<p>To prove the intensity of the desire for the bottle,
and the difficulty, often insurmountable, of overcoming
it, I extract the following interesting and highly
characteristic anecdote from a recent publication:—“A
gentleman of very amiable dispositions, and
justly popular, contracted habits of intemperance:
his friends argued, implored, remonstrated; at last
he put an end to all importunity in this manner:—To
a friend who was addressing him in the following
strain—‘Dear Sir George, your family are in
the utmost distress on account of this unfortunate
habit; they perceive that business is neglected;
your moral influence is gone; your health is ruined;
and, depend upon it, the coats of your stomach will
soon give way, and then a change will come too
late.’ The poor victim, deeply convinced of the
hopelessness of his case, replied thus—‘My good
friend, your remarks are just; they are, indeed, too
true; but I can no longer resist temptation: if a
bottle of brandy stood at one hand, and the pit of
hell yawned at the other, and if I were convinced I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
would be pushed in as sure as I took one glass, I
could not refrain. You are very kind. I ought to
be grateful for so many kind good friends, but you
may spare yourselves the trouble of trying to reform
me: the thing is impossible.’”</p>

<p>The observation of almost every man must have
furnished him with cases not less striking than the
above. I could relate many such which have
occurred in my own practice, but shall at present
content myself with one.—I was lately consulted by
a young gentleman of fortune from the north of
England. He was aged twenty-six, and was one
of the most lamentable instances of the resistless
tyranny of this wretched habit that can possibly be
imagined. Every morning, before breakfast, he
drank a bottle of brandy: another he consumed
between breakfast and dinner; and a third shortly
before going to bed. Independently of this, he
indulged in wine and whatever liquor came within
his reach. Even during the hours usually appropriated
to sleep, the same system was pursued—brandy
being placed at the bed side for his use in
the night-time. To this destructive vice he had
been addicted since his sixteenth year; and it had
gone on increasing from day to day, till it had
acquired its then alarming and almost incredible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
magnitude. In vain did he try to resist the insidious
poison. With the perfect consciousness that
he was rapidly destroying himself, and with every
desire to struggle against the insatiable cravings of his
diseased appetite, he found it utterly impossible to
offer the slightest opposition to them. Intolerable
sickness, faintings, and tremors, followed every
attempt to abandon his potations; and had they been
taken suddenly away from him, it cannot be doubted
that delirium tremens and death would have been
the result.</p>

<p>There are many persons that cannot be called
drunkards, who, nevertheless, indulge pretty freely
in the bottle, though after reasonable intervals.
Such persons usually possess abundance of health,
and resist intoxication powerfully. Here the
stomach and system in general lose their irritability,
in the same way as in confirmed topers, but this is
more from torpor than from weakness. The springs
of life become less delicate; the pivots on which
they move get, as it were, clogged, and, though
existence goes on with vigour, it is not the bounding
and elastic vigour of perfect health. This
proceeds, not from debility, but from torpor; the
muscular fibre becoming, like the hands of a labouring
man, hardened and blunted in its sensibilities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Such are the effects brought on by a <i>frequent</i> use
of inebriating agents, but an <i>excessive</i> use in every
case gives rise to weakness. This the system can
only escape by a proper interval being allowed to
elapse between our indulgences. But if dose be
heaped on dose, before it has time to rally from
former exhaustion, it becomes more and more
debilitated; the blood ceases to circulate with its
wonted force; the secretions get defective, and the
tone of the living fibre daily enfeebled. A debauch
fevers the system, and no man can stand a perpetual
succession of fevers without injuring himself, and at
last destroying life.</p>

<p>Drunkenness, in the long run, changes its character.
The sensations of the confirmed tippler, when intoxicated,
are nothing, in point of pleasure, to those
of the habitually temperate man, in the same condition.
We drink at first for the serenity which is
diffused over the mind, and not from any positive
love we bear to the liquor. But, in the course of
time, the influence of the latter, in producing gay
images, is deadened. It is then chiefly a mere
animal fondness for drink which actuates us. We
like the taste of it, as a child likes sweetmeats;
and the stomach, for a series of years, has been so
accustomed to an unnatural stimulus, that it cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
perform its functions properly without it. In such
a case, it may readily be believed that liquor could
not be suddenly removed with safety.</p>

<p>The habit will sometimes be checked by operating
skilfully upon the mind. If the person has a feeling
heart, much may be done by representing to him the
state of misery into which he will plunge himself,
his family, and his friends. Some men, by a strong
effort, have given up liquors at once, in consequence
of such representations.</p>

<p>Some drunkards have attempted to cure themselves
by the assumption of voluntary oaths. They
go before a magistrate, and swear that, for a certain
period, they shall not taste liquors of any kind; and
it is but just to state, that these oaths are sometimes
strictly enough kept. They are, however, much
oftener broken—the physical cravings for the bottle
prevailing over whatever religious obligation may
have been entered into. Such a proceeding is as
absurd as it is immoral, and never answers the
purpose of effecting any thing like a radical cure;
for, although the person abides by his solemn engagement,
it is only to resume his old habits more
inveterately than ever, the moment it expires.</p>

<p>Many men become drunkards from family broils.
They find no comfort at home, and gladly seek for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
it out of doors. In such cases, it will be almost
impossible to break the habit. The domestic
sympathies and affections, which oppose a barrier
to dissipation, and wean away the mind from the
bottle, have here no room to act. When the mother
of a family becomes addicted to liquor, the case is
very afflicting. Home, instead of being the seat of
comfort and order, becomes a species of Pandemonium:
the social circle is broken up, and all its
happiness destroyed. In this case, there is no
remedy but the removal of the drunkard. A feeling
of perversity has been known to effect a cure among
the fair sex. A man of Philadelphia, who was
afflicted with a drunken wife, put a cask of rum in
her way, in the charitable hope that she would drink
herself to death. She suspected the scheme, and,
from a mere principle of contradiction, abstained in
all time coming, from any sort of indulgence in the
bottle. I may mention another American anecdote
of a person reclaimed from drunkenness, by means
not less singular. A man in Maryland, notoriously
addicted to this vice, hearing an uproar in his
kitchen one evening, felt a curiosity to step without
noise to the door, to know what was the matter,
when he beheld his servants indulging in the most
unbounded roar of laughter at a couple of his negro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
boys, who were mimicking himself in his drunken
fits, showing how he reeled and staggered—how he
looked and nodded, and hiccupped and tumbled.
The picture which these children of nature drew of
him, and which had filled the rest with so much
merriment, struck him so forcibly, that he became
a perfectly sober man, to the unspeakable joy of
his wife and children.</p>

<p>Man is very much the creature of habit. By
drinking regularly at certain times, he feels the
longing for liquor at the stated return of those
periods—as after dinner, or immediately before
going to bed, or whatever the period may be. He
even feels it in certain companies, or in a particular
tavern at which he is in the habit of taking his libations.
We have all heard the story of the man who
could never pass an inn on the road-side without
entering it and taking a glass, and who, when, after
a violent effort, he succeeded in getting beyond the
spot, straightway returned to reward himself with
a bumper for his resolution. It is a good rule for
drunkards to break all such habits. Let the frequenter
of drinking clubs, masonic lodges, and other
Bacchanalian assemblages, leave off attending these
places; and if he must drink, let him do so at home,
where there is every likelihood his potations will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
be less liberal. Let him also forswear the society
of boon companions, either in his own habitation or
in theirs. Let him, if he can manage it, remove
from the place of his usual residence, and go somewhere
else. Let him also take abundance of exercise,
court the society of intellectual and sober persons,
and turn his attention to reading, or gardening, or
sailing, or whatever other amusement he has a fancy
for. By following this advice rigidly, he will get
rid of that baleful habit which haunts him like his
shadow, and intrudes itself by day and by night into
the sanctuary of his thoughts. And if he refuses
to lay aside the Circean cup, let him reflect that
Disease waits upon his steps—that Dropsy, Palsy,
Emaciation, Poverty, and Idiotism, followed by the
pale phantom, Death, pursue him like attendant
spirits, and claim him as their prey.</p>

<p>Sometimes an attack of disease has the effect of
sobering drunkards for the rest of their lives. I
knew a gentleman who had apoplexy in consequence
of dissipation. He fortunately recovered, but the
danger which he had escaped made such an impression
upon his mind, that he never, till his dying
day, tasted any liquor stronger than simple water.
Many persons, after such changes, become remarkably
lean; but this is not an unhealthy emaciation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Their mental powers also suffer a very material
improvement—the intellect becoming more powerful,
and the moral feelings more soft and refined.</p>

<p>In a small treatise on Naval Discipline, lately
published, the following whimsical and ingenious
mode of punishing drunken seamen is recommended:—“Separate
for one month every man who was
found drunk, from the rest of the crew: mark his
clothes ‘drunkard;’ give him six-water grog, or,
if beer, mixed one-half water; let them dine when
the crew had finished; employ them in every dirty
and disgraceful work, &amp;c. This had such a salutary
effect, that in less than six months not a drunken
man was to be found in the ship. The same system
was introduced by the writer into every ship on
board which he subsequently served. When first
lieutenant of the Victory and Diomede, the beneficial
consequences were acknowledged—the culprits
were heard to say, that they would rather receive
six dozen lashes at the gangway, and be done with
it, than be put into the ‘drunken mess’ (for so it
was named) for a month.”</p>

<p>Those persons who have been for many years in
the habit of indulging largely in drink, and to whom
it has become an <i>elixir vitæ</i> indispensable to their
happiness, cannot be suddenly deprived of it. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
should be done by slow degrees, and must be the
result of conviction. If the quantity be forcibly
diminished against the person’s will, no good can be
done; he will only seize the first opportunity to
remunerate himself for what he has been deprived
of, and proceed to greater excesses than before. If
his mind can be brought, by calm reflection, to
submit to the decrease, much may be accomplished
in the way of reformation. Many difficulties undoubtedly
attend this gradual process, and no
ordinary strength of mind is required for its completion.
It is, however, less dangerous than the
method recommended by Dr. Trotter, and ultimately
much more effectual. Even although his plan were
free of hazard, its effects are not likely to be lasting.
The unnatural action, to which long intemperance
had given rise, clings to the system with pertinacious
adherence. The remembrance of liquor, like a
delightful vision, still attaches itself to the drunkard’s
mind; and he longs with insufferable ardour, to
feel once more the ecstasies to which it gave birth.
This is the consequence of a too rapid separation.
Had the sympathies of nature been gradually
operated upon, there would have been less violence,
and the longings had a better chance of wearing
insensibly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>Among the great authorities for acting in this
manner, may be mentioned the celebrated Dr.
Pitcairn. In attempting to break the habit in a
Highland chieftain, one of his patients, he exacted
a promise that the latter would every day drop as
much sealing-wax into his glass as would receive
the impression of his seal. He did so, and as the
wax accumulated, the capacity of the glass diminished,
and, consequently, the quantity of whisky it
was capable of containing. By this plan he was
cured of his bad habit altogether. In mentioning
such a whimsical proceeding, I do not mean particularly
to recommend it for adoption; although I
am satisfied that the principle on which its eccentric
contriver proceeded was substantially correct.</p>

<p>A strong argument against too sudden a change
is afforded in the case of food. I have remarked
that persons who are in the daily habit of eating
animal food feel a sense of weakness about the
stomach if they suddenly discontinue it, and live
for a few days entirely upon vegetables. This I
have experienced personally, in various trials made
for the purpose; and every person in health, and
accustomed to good living, will, I am persuaded,
feel the same thing. The stomach, from want of
stimulus loses its tone; the craving for animal food<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
is strong and incessant; and, if it be resisted, heartburn,
water-brash, and other forms of indigestion,
are sure to ensue. In such a case vegetables are
loathed as intolerably insipid, and even bread is
looked upon with disrelish and aversion. It is
precisely the same with liquors. Their sudden
discontinuance, where they have been long made use
of, is almost sure to produce the same, and even
worse consequences to the individual.</p>

<p>I cannot give any directions with regard to the
regimen of a reformed drunkard. This will depend
upon different circumstances, such as age, constitution,
diseases, and manner of living. It may be
laid down as a general rule, that it ought to be as
little heating as possible. A milk or vegetable diet
will commonly be preferable to every other. But
there are cases in which food of a richer quality is
requisite, as when there is much emaciation and
debility. Here it may even be necessary to give a
moderate quantity of wine. In gout, likewise, too
great a change of living is not always salutary,
more especially in advanced years, where there is
weakness of the digestive organs, brought on by
the disease. In old age, wine is often useful to
sustain the system, more especially when sinking
by the process of natural decay. The older a person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
is, the greater the inconvenience of abstaining all at
once from liquors, and the more slowly ought they
to be taken away. I cannot bring myself to believe
that a man who for half a century has drunk freely,
can suddenly discontinue this ancient habit without
a certain degree of risk: the idea is opposed to all
that we know of the bodily and mental functions.</p>

<p>In attempting to cure the habit of drunkenness,
opium may sometimes be used with advantage. By
giving it in moderate quantities, the liquor which
the person is in the habit of taking, may be diminished
to a considerable extent, and he may thus
be enabled to leave them off altogether. There is
only one risk, and it is this—that he may become
as confirmed a votary of opium as he was before of
strong liquors. Of two evils, however, we should
always choose the least: and it is certain that however
perniciously opium may act upon the system,
its moral effects and its power of injuring reputation
are decidedly less formidable than those of the
ordinary intoxicating agents.</p>

<p>The following anecdote has been communicated
to me by the late Mr. Alexander Balfour, (Author
of “Contemplation,” “Weeds and Wildflowers,”
and other ingenious works,) and exhibits a mode of
curing dram-drinking equally novel and effective:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>About the middle of last century, in a provincial
town on the east coast of Scotland, where smuggling
was common, it was the practice for two respectable
merchants to gratify themselves with a social glass
of good Hollands, for which purpose they regularly
adjourned, at a certain hour, to a neighbouring gin-shop.
It happened one morning that something
prevented one of them from calling on his neighbour
at the usual time. Many a wistful and longing look
was cast for the friend so unaccountably absent, but
he came not. His disappointed companion would
not go to the dram-shop alone; but he afterwards
acknowledged that the want of his accustomed cordial
rendered him uneasy the whole day. However,
this feeling induced him to reflect upon the bad
habit he was acquiring, and the consequences which
were likely to follow. He therefore resolved to
discontinue dram-drinking entirely, but found it
difficult to put his resolution into practice, until,
after some deliberation, he hit upon the following
expedient:—Filling a bottle with excellent Hollands,
he lodged it in his back-shop, and the first morning
taking his dram, he replaced it with simple water.
Next morning he took a second dram, replacing it
with water; and in this manner he went on, replacing
the fluid subtracted from the bottle with water,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
till at last the mixture became insipid and ultimately
nauseous, which had such an effect upon his palate,
that he was completely cured of his bad habit, and
continued to live in exemplary soberness till his
death, which happened in extreme old age.</p>

<p>Dr. Kain, an American physician, recommends
tartar emetic for the cure of habitual drunkenness.
“Possessing,” he observes, “no positive taste itself,
it communicates a disgusting quality to those fluids
in which it is dissolved. I have often seen persons
who, from taking a medicine in the form of antimonial
wine, could never afterwards drink wine.
Nothing, therefore, seems better calculated to form
our indication of breaking up the association, in the
patient’s feelings, between his disease and the relief
to be obtained from stimulating liquors. These
liquors, with the addition of a very small quantity
of emetic tartar, instead of relieving, increase the
sensation of loathing of food, and quickly produce
in the patient an indomitable repugnance to the
vehicle of its administration.” “My method of
prescribing it, has varied according to the habits,
age, and constitution of the patient. I give it only
in alterative and slightly nauseating doses. A convenient
preparation of the medicine is eight grains
dissolved in four ounces of boiling water—half an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
ounce of the solution to be put into a half-pint, pint,
or quart of the patient’s favourite liquor, and to be
taken daily in divided portions. If severe vomiting
and purging ensue, I should direct laudanum to
allay the irritation, and diminish the dose. In every
patient it should be varied according to its effects.
In one instance, in a patient who lived ten miles
from me, severe vomiting was produced, more, I
think, from excessive drinking, than the use of the
remedy. He recovered from it, however, without
any bad effects. In some cases, the change suddenly
produced in the patient’s habits, has brought
on considerable lassitude and debility, which were
of but short duration. In a majority of cases, no
other effect has been perceptible than slight nausea,
some diarrhœa, and a gradual, but very uniform,
distaste to the menstruum.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Having tried tartar emetic in several instances, I
can bear testimony to its good effects in habitual
drunkenness. The active ingredient in Chambers’s
celebrated nostrum for the cure of ebriety, was this
medicine. Tartar emetic, however, must always be
used with caution, and never except under the eye
of a medical man, as the worst consequences might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
ensue from the indiscreet employment of so active
an agent.</p>

<p>It seems probable that, in plethoric subjects, the
habit of drunkenness might be attacked with some
success by the application of leeches, cold applications
and blisters to the head, accompanied by purgatives
and nauseating doses of tartar emetic. Dr.
Caldwell of Lexington, conceives drunkenness to be
entirely a disease of the brain, especially of the animal
compartments of this viscus, and more especially of
that portion called by phrenologists the organ of
<i>alimentiveness</i>, on which the appetite for food and
drink is supposed mainly to depend. Should his
views be correct, the above treatment seems eligible,
at least in drunkards of a full habit of body, and
in such cases it is certainly worthy of a full trial. I
refer the reader to Dr. Caldwell’s Essay, in which
both the above doctrine and the practice founded
upon it are very ably discussed. It is, indeed, one
of the ablest papers which has hitherto appeared
upon the subject of drunkenness.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>It very often happens, after a long course of dissipation,
that the stomach loses its tone, and rejects
almost every thing that is swallowed. The remedy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
in this case, is opium, which should be given in the
solid form in preference to any other. Small quantities
of negus are also beneficial; and the carbonate
of ammonia, combined with some aromatic, is frequently
attended with the best effects. When there
is much prostration of strength, wine should always
be given. In such a case the entire removal of the
long-accustomed stimulus would be attended with
the worst effects. This must be done gradually.</p>

<p>Enervated drunkards will reap much benefit by
removing to the country, if their usual residence is
in town. The free air and exercise renovate their
enfeebled frames; new scenes are presented to
occupy their attention; and, the mind being withdrawn
from former scenes, the chain of past associations
is broken in two.</p>

<p>Warm and cold bathing will occasionally be
useful, according to circumstances. Bitters are not
to be recommended, especially if employed under
the medium of spirits. When there is much debility,
chalybeates will prove serviceable. A visit to places
where there are mineral springs is of use, not only
from the waters, but from the agreeable society to
be met with at such quarters. The great art of
breaking the habit consists in managing the drunkard
with kindness and address. This management must,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
of course, be modified by the events which present
themselves, and which will vary in different cases.</p>

<p>Persons residing in tropical climates ought, more
than others, to avoid intoxicating liquors. It is too
much the practice in the West Indies to allay thirst
by copious draughts of rum punch. In the East
Indies, the natives, with greater propriety, principally
use rice-water (congee); while the Europeans
residing there, are in the habit of indulging in
Champaign, Madeira, and other rich wines, which
may in a great measure account for the mortality
prevailing among them in that region. A fearful
demoralization, as well as loss of life, is occasioned
among the British troops in the East and West
Indies, from the cheapness of spirituous liquors,
which enables them to indulge in them to excess.
“Since the institution of the Recorder’s and
Supreme Courts at Madras,” says Sir Thomas
Hislop, “no less than thirty-four British soldiers
have forfeited their lives for murder, and most of
them were committed in their intoxicated moments.”
Dr. Rollo relates, that the 45th regiment while
stationed in Grenada, lost within a very few weeks,
twenty-six men out of ninety-six; at a time, too,
when the island was remarkably healthy. On
inquiry, it was found that the common breakfast of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
the men was raw spirits and pork. It is remarked
by Desgenettes, in his Medical History of the
French Army in Egypt, that, “daily experience
demonstrates that almost all the soldiers who indulge
in intemperate habits, and are attacked with fevers,
never recover.” In countries where the solar influence
is felt with such force, we cannot be too temperate.
The food should be chiefly vegetable, and
the drink as unirritating as possible. It may be
laid down as an axiom, that in these regions, wine
and ardent spirits are invariably hurtful; not only
in immediately heating the body, but in exposing it
to the influence of other diseases.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> A great portion
of the deaths which occur among Europeans in the
tropics, are brought on by excess. Instead of suiting
their regimen to the climate, they persist in the
habits of their own country, without reflecting that
what is comparatively harmless in one region, is
most destructive in another. There cannot be a
stronger proof of this than the French troops in the
West Indies having almost always suffered less in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
proportion to their numbers than the British, who are
unquestionably more addicted to intemperance. “I
aver from my own knowledge and custom,” observes
Dr. Mosely, “as from the custom and observation
of others, that those who drink <i>nothing but water</i>,
are but little affected by the climate, and can undergo
the greatest fatigue without inconvenience.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>It is a common practice in the West of Scotland
to send persons who are excessively addicted to
drunkenness, to rusticate and learn sobriety on the
islands of Loch Lomond. There are, I believe,
two islands appropriated for the purpose, where
the convicts meet with due attention, and whatever
indulgences their friends choose to extend towards
them. Whether such a proceeding is consistent
with law, or well adapted to answer the end in view,
may be reasonably doubted; but of its severity, as a
punishment, there can be no question. It is indeed
impossible to inflict any penalty upon drunkards so
great as that of absolutely debarring them from
indulging in liquor.</p>

<p>In the next Chapter, I shall consider the method
of curing and preventing drunkenness by means of
Temperance Societies.</p>

<span class="smaller">TEMPERANCE SOCIETIES.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Much has been said and written of late concerning
Temperance Societies. They have been represented
by their friends as powerful engines for effecting a
total reformation from drunkenness, and improving
the whole face of society, by introducing a purer
morality, and banishing the hundred-headed monster,
intemperance, and all its accompanying vices,
from the world. By their opponents, they have
been ridiculed as visionary and impracticable—as,
at best, but temporary in their influence—as erroneous
in many of their leading views—as tyrannical,
unsocial, and hypocritical. Their members are
represented as enthusiasts and fanatics; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
more active portion of them—those who lecture on
the subject, and go about founding Societies—traduced
as fools or impostors. Such are the various
views entertained by different minds of Temperance
Societies; but, leaving it to others to argue the
point, for or against, according to their inclinations,
I shall simply state what I think myself of these
institutions—how far they do good or harm—and
under what circumstances they ought to be thought
favourably of, or the reverse. Truth generally lies
<i>in mediis rebus</i>, and I suspect they will not form an
exception to the rule.</p>

<p>Temperance Societies proceed upon the belief
that ardent spirits are, <i>under all circumstances</i>, injurious
to people in health, and that, therefore, they
ought to be altogether abandoned. I am anxious
to think favourably of any plan which has for its
object the eradication of drunkenness; and shall
therefore simply express my belief that those
Societies have done good, and ought therefore to be
regarded with a favourable eye. That they have
succeeded, or ever will succeed, in reclaiming any
considerable number of drunkards, I have great
doubts; but that they may have the effect of preventing
many individuals from becoming drunkards,
is exceedingly probable. If this can be proved—which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
I think it may be without much difficulty—it
follows that they are beneficial in their nature, and
consequently, deserving of encouragement. That
they are wrong in supposing ardent spirits <i>invariably</i>
hurtful in health, and they are also in error in
advocating the instant abandonment, <i>in all cases</i>, of
intoxicating liquors, I have little doubt; but that
they are correct in their great leading views of the
pernicious effects of spirits to mankind in general,
and that their principles, if carried into effect, will
produce good, is self-evident. Spirits when used
in moderation, cannot be looked upon as pernicious:
nay, in certain cases, even in health, they are
beneficial and necessary. In countries subject to
intermittents, it is very well known that those who
indulge moderately in spirits are much less subject
to these diseases than the strictly abstinent. “At
Walcheren it was remarked that those officers and
soldiers who took schnaps, <i>alias</i> drams, in the
morning, and smoked, escaped the fever which was
so destructive to the British troops; and the natives
generally insisted upon doing so before going out
in the morning.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The following anecdote is
equally in point. It took place on the Niagara<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
frontier of Upper Canada, in the year 1813. “A
British regiment, from some accident, was prevented
from receiving the usual supply of spirits, and in a
very short time more than two thirds of the men
were on the sick list from ague or dysentery; while,
the very next year on the same ground, and in
almost every respect under the same circumstances
except that the men had their usual allowance of
spirits, the sickness was extremely trifling. Every
person acquainted with the circumstances believed
that the diminution of the sick, during the latter
period, was attributable to the men having received
the quantity of spirits to which they had been habituated.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Indeed, I am persuaded that while, in
the tropics, stimulating liquors are highly prejudicial,
and often occasion, while they never prevent,
disease, they are frequently of great service in
accomplishing the latter object in damp foggy
countries, especially when fatigue, poor diet, agues,
dysenteries, and other diseases of debility are to
be contended against. It has been stated, and, I
believe, with much truth, that the dysentery which
has prevailed so much of late among the poorer
classes in this country, has been in many cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
occasioned, and in others aggravated, in consequence
of the want of spirits, which, from the depressed
state of trade, the working classes are unable to
procure; and should this assertion turn out to be
correct, it follows, that Temperance Societies, by
the rigid abstinence urged upon their members, have
contributed to increase the evil. The system is
fortified against this disorder, as well as various
others, by a proper use of stimuli; while excess in
the indulgence of these agents exposes it to the
attack of every disease and invariably aggravates
the danger. Water is unquestionably the natural
drink of man, but in the existing condition of things,
we are no longer in a state of nature, and cases consequently
often occur wherein we must depart from
her original principles. There are many persons
who find a moderate use of spirits necessary to the
enjoyment of health. In these cases it would be
idle to abandon them. They ought only to be given
up when their use is not required by the system.
That such is the case in a great majority of instances,
must be fully admitted; and it is to these that the
principles of Temperance Societies can be applied
with advantage. Considering the matter in this
light, the conclusion, we must come to is simply that
ardent spirits sometimes do good, but much oftener<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
mischief. By abandoning them altogether, we
escape the mischief and lose the good. Such is the
inevitable effect, supposing Temperance Societies
to come into general operation. It remains, therefore,
with people themselves to determine whether
they are capable of using spirits only when they are
beneficial, and then with a due regard to moderation.
If they have so little self-command, the sooner they
connect themselves with Temperance Societies the
better. I believe that by a moderate indulgence in
spirits no man can be injured, and that many will
often be benefited. It is their abuse which renders
them a curse rather than a blessing to mankind;
and it is with this abuse alone I find fault, in the
same way as I would object to excess in eating, or
any other excess. People, therefore, would do
well to draw a distinction between the proper use
and the abuse of these stimulants, and regulate
themselves accordingly.</p>

<p>Temperance Societies, however, though erroneous
in some of their principles, and injurious as
applied to particular cases, may be of great use
towards society in general. Proceeding upon the
well-known fact that ardent spirits are peculiarly
apt to be abused, and habitual drunkenness to ensue,
they place these agents under the ban of total interdiction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and thus arrest the march of that baneful
evil occasioned by their excessive use. So far,
therefore, as the individual members of these institutions
are concerned, a great good is effected at the
sacrifice of comparatively little. On such grounds,
I fully admit their beneficial effects, and wish them
all success. At the same time, many sober persons
would not wish to connect themselves with them,
for the plain reason—that having never felt any
bad effects from the small quantity of ardent spirits
they are in the habit of taking, but, on the contrary,
sometimes been the better for it—they would
feel averse to come under any obligation to abstain
from these liquors altogether. Such, I confess, are
my own feelings on this subject; and in stating them,
I am fully aware that the advocates of the Societies
will answer—that a man’s private inclinations should
be sacrificed to public good, and that for the sake
of a general example, he should abandon that which,
though harmless to him, in the limited extent to
which he indulges in it, is pernicious to the mass of
mankind. This argument is not without point, and
upon many will tell with good effect, though, I
believe, people in general will either not acknowledge
its force, or at least, refuse to act up to it.</p>

<p>Temperance Societies have had one effect: they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
have lessened the consumpt of spirituous liquors to
a vast extent, and have left that of wines and malt
liquors undiminished, or rather increased it; for
although the more strict members avoid even them,
their use is not interdicted by the rules of the
Societies. By thus diminishing the consumption of
spirits, they have been the means of shutting up
many small public houses; of keeping numerous
tradesmen and labourers from the tavern; of encouraging
such persons to sober habits, by recommending
coffee instead of strong liquor; and, generally
speaking, of promoting industry and temperance.</p>

<p>If a person were disposed to be very censorious,
he might object to some other things connected with
them, such as the inconsistency of allowing their
members to drink wine and malt liquors, while they
debar them from ardent spirits. They do this on
the ground that on the two first a man is much less
likely to become a drunkard than upon spirits—a
fact which may be fairly admitted, but which, I
believe, arises, in some measure, from its requiring
more money to get drunk upon malt liquors and
wine than upon spirits. In abandoning the latter,
however, and having recourse to the others, it is
proper to state, that the person often practises a
delusion upon himself; for in drinking wine, such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
at least as it is procured in this country, he in reality
consumes a large proportion of pure spirits; and
malt liquors contain not only the alcoholic principle
of intoxication, but are often sophisticated, as we
have already seen, with narcotics. I believe that,
though not in the majority of cases, yet in some,
spirits in moderation are better for the system than
malt liquors: this is especially the case in plethoric
and dyspeptic subjects. Independently of this, it
is much more difficult to get rid of the effects of the
latter. Much exercise is required for this purpose;
and if such is neglected, and the person is of full
habit of body, it would have been better if he had
stuck by his toddy than run the risk of getting
overloaded with fat, and dropping down in a fit of
apoplexy.</p>

<p>I know several members of the Temperance
Society who are practising upon themselves the
delusion in question. They shun spirits, but indulge
largely in porter—to the extent perhaps of a bottle
a-day. Nobody can deny that by this practice they
will suffer a great deal more than if they took a
tumbler or so of toddy daily; and the consequences
are the more pernicious, because, while indulging
in these libations, they imagine themselves to be all
the while paragons of sobriety. Rather than have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
permitted such a license to their members, Temperance
Societies should have proscribed malt
liquors as they have done spirits. As it is, a person
may be a member, and follow the rules of the
Societies, while he is all the time habituating himself
to drunkenness. These facts, with all my
respect for Temperance Societies, and firm belief in
their utility, I am compelled to mention; and I do
so the more readily, as there is a large balance of
good in their favour, to overweigh whatever bad
may be brought against them.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this, the fact that a habit of
drunkenness is far more likely to be caused by indulging
habitually in spirits than in any thing else,
is undeniable; and Temperance Societies, in lessening
the consumpt of spirits, have accomplished a
certain good, in so far as they have thus been the
means of diminishing, to a considerable extent, the
vice of drunkenness, of reclaiming a few topers, and
preventing many from becoming so who would certainly
have fallen into the snare, had they not been
timously checked by their influence and example.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have to repeat that I do not
agree with the Societies in considering ardent spirits
always hurtful in health, or in recommending the
instant disuse of liquor in all cases of drunkenness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
The reasons for entertaining my own opinions on
these points are given in the work, and they are
satisfactory to myself, whatever they may be to
others. At the same time, I fully admit that these
institutions may often prove eminently useful, and
that the cases wherein they may be injurious to
those connected with them, are not many, compared
to the mass of good which they are capable of effecting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
The man, therefore, who feels the appetite
for liquor stealing upon him, cannot adopt a wiser
plan than to connect himself with a body, the members
of which will keep him in countenance in
sobriety, and, by their example, perhaps wean him
away from the bottle, and thus arrest him on the
road to ruin.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">ADVICE TO INVETERATE DRUNKARDS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>If a man is resolved to continue a drunkard, it may
here be proper to mention in what manner he can
do so with least risk to himself. One of the principal
rules to be observed, not only by him, but by
habitually sober people, is never to take any inebriating
liquor, especially spirits, upon an empty
stomach. There is no habit more common or more
destructive than this: it not only intoxicates readier
than when food has been previously taken, but it
has a much greater tendency to impair the functions
of the digestive organs. In addition, drunkards
should shun raw spirits, which more rapidly bring
on disease of the stomach, than when used in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
diluted state. These fluids are safe in proportion
to the state of their dilution; but to this general
rule there is one exception, <i>viz.</i> punch. This though
the most diluted form in which they are used, is, I
suspect, nearly the very worst—not from the weakness
of the mixture, but from the acid which is
combined with it. This acid, although for the time
being, it braces the stomach, and enables it to withstand
a greater portion of liquor than it would
otherwise do, has ultimately the most pernicious
effect upon this organ—giving rise to thickening of
its coats, heartburn, and all the usual distressing
phenomena of indigestion. Other organs, such as
the kidneys, also suffer, and gravelly complaints are
apt to be induced. A common belief prevails that
punch is more salubrious than any other spirituous
compound, but this is grounded on erroneous premises.
When people sit down to drink punch, they
are not so apt—owing to the great length of time
which elapses ere such a weak fluid produces
intoxication—to be betrayed into excess as when
indulging in toddy. In this point of view it may
be said to be less injurious; but let the same
quantity of spirits be taken in the form of punch, as
in that of grog or toddy, and there can be no doubt
that in the long run the consequences will be far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
more fatal to the constitution. If we commit a
debauch on punch, the bad consequences cling much
longer to the system than those proceeding from a
similar debauch upon any other combination of
ardent spirits. In my opinion, the safest way of
using those liquids is in the shape of grog.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Cold
toddy, or a mixture of spirits, cold water, and sugar,
ranks next in the scale of safety; then warm toddy;
then cold punch—and raw spirit is the most pernicious
of all.</p>

<p>The malt-liquor drunkard should, as a general
rule, prefer porter to strong ale. Herb ale and
purl are very pernicious, but the lighter varieties,
such as small beer and home-brewed, are not only
harmless, but even useful. The person who indulges
in malt liquor should take much exercise. If he
neglects this, and yields to the indolence apt to be
induced by these fluids, he becomes fat and stupid,
and has a strong tendency to apoplexy, and other
diseases of plethora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>As to the wine-bibber, no directions can be given
which will prove very satisfactory. The varieties
of wines are so numerous, that any complete estimate
of their respective powers is here impossible.
It may, however, be laid down as a general rule,
that those which are most diuretic, and excite least
headach and fever are the safest for the constitution.
The light dry wines, such as Hock, Claret,
Burgundy, Bucellas, Rhenish, and Hermitage,
are, generally speaking, more salubrious than the
stronger varieties, such as Port, Sherry, or Madeira.
Claret, in particular, is the most wholesome wine
that is known. Tokay,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Frontignac, Malmsey,
Vino Tinto, Montifiascone, Canary, and other sweet
wines, are apt, in consequence of their imperfect
fermentation, to produce acid upon weak stomachs;
but in other cases they are delightful drinks; and
when there is no tendency to acidity in the system,
they may be taken with comparative safety to a
considerable extent. Whenever there is disease,
attention must be paid to the wines best adapted to
its particular nature. For instance, in gout, the
acescent wines, such as Hock and Claret, must be
avoided, and Sherry or Madeira, substituted in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
room; and should even this run into the acetous
fermentation, it must be laid aside, and replaced by
weak brandy and water. Champaign, except in
cases of weak digestion, is one of the safest wines
that can be drunk. Its intoxicating effects are
rapid, but exceedingly transient, and depend partly
upon the carbonic acid which is evolved from it,
and partly upon the alcohol which is suspended in
this gas, being applied rapidly and extensively to a
large surface of the stomach.</p>

<p>Drunkards will do well to follow the maxim of
the facetious Morgan Odoherty, and never mix their
wines. Whatever wine they commence with, to
that let them adhere throughout the evening. If
there be any case where this rule may be transgressed
with safety, it is perhaps in favour of Claret,
a moderate quantity of which is both pleasant and
refreshing after a course of Port or Madeira. Nor
is the voice of the same eccentric authority, with
regard to malt liquors, less just or less worthy of
observance—the toper being recommended to abstain
scrupulously from such fluids when he means beforehand
to “make an evening of it,” and sit long at
the bottle. The mixture, unquestionably, not only
disorders the stomach, but effectually weakens the
ability of the person to withstand the forthcoming
debauch.</p>

<span class="smaller">EFFECTS OF INTOXICATING AGENTS ON NURSES AND CHILDREN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Women, especially in a low station, who act as
nurses, are strongly addicted to the practice of
drinking porter and ales, for the purpose of augmenting
their milk. This very common custom
cannot be sufficiently deprecated. It is often pernicious
to both parties, and may lay the foundation
of a multitude of diseases in the infant. The milk,
which ought to be bland and unirritating, acquires
certain heating qualities, and becomes deteriorated
to a degree of which those unaccustomed to investigate
such matters have little conception. The
child nursed by a drunkard is hardly ever healthy.
It is, in a particular manner, subject to derangements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
of the digestive organs, and convulsive affections.
With regard to the latter, Dr. North<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
remarks, that he has seen them almost instantly
removed by the child being transferred to a temperate
woman. I have observed the same thing,
not only in convulsive cases, but in many others.
Nor are liquors the only agents whose properties
are communicable to the nursling. It is the same
with regard to opium, tobacco, and other narcotics.
Purgatives transmit their powers in a similar manner,
so much so, that nothing is more common than for
the child suckled by a woman who has taken physic,
to be affected with bowel complaint. No woman is
qualified to be a nurse, unless strictly sober; and
though stout children are sometimes reared by persons
who indulge to a considerable extent in liquor,
there can be no doubt that they are thereby exposed
to risk, and that they would have had a much better
chance of doing well, if the same quantity of milk
had been furnished by natural means. If a woman
cannot afford the necessary supply without these
indulgences, she should give over the infant to some
one who can, and drop nursing altogether. The
only cases in which a moderate portion of malt liquor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
is justifiable, are when the milk is deficient, and the
nurse averse or unable to put another in her place.
Here, of two evils, we choose the least, and rather
give the infant milk of an inferior quality, than
endanger its health, by weaning it prematurely, or
stinting it of its accustomed nourishment.</p>

<p>Connected with this subject is the practice of
administering stimulating liquors to children. This
habit is so common in some parts of Scotland, that
infants of a few days old are often forced to swallow
raw whisky. In like manner, great injury is often
inflicted upon children by the frequent administration
of laudanum, paregoric, Godfrey’s Cordial, and
other preparations of opium. The child in a short
time becomes pallid, emaciated, and fretful, and is
subject to convulsive attacks, and every variety of
disorder in the stomach and bowels. Vomiting,
diarrhœa, and other affections of the digestive
system ensue, and atrophy, followed by death, is
too often the consequence.</p>

<p>An experiment made by Dr. Hunter upon two
of his children, illustrates in a striking manner the
pernicious effects of even a small portion of intoxicating
liquors, in persons of that tender age. To
one of the children he gave, every day after dinner,
a full glass of Sherry: the child was five years of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
age, and unaccustomed to the use of wine. To the
other child, of nearly the same age, and equally
unused to wine, he gave an orange. In the course
of a week, a very marked difference was perceptible
in the pulse, urine, and evacuations from the bowels
of the two children. The pulse of the first child
was raised, the urine high coloured, and the evacuations
destitute of their usual quantity of bile. In
the other child, no change whatever was produced.
He then reversed the experiment, giving to the
first the orange, and to the second the wine, and the
results corresponded: the child who had the orange
continued well, and the system of the other got
straightway into disorder, as in the first experiment.
Parents should therefore be careful not to allow their
youthful offspring stimulating liquors of any kind,
except in cases of disease, and then only under the
guidance of a medical attendant. The earlier persons
are initiated in the use of liquor, the more
completely does it gain dominion over them, and
the more difficult is the passion for it to be eradicated.
Children naturally dislike liquors—a pretty
convincing proof that in early life they are totally
uncalled for, and that they only become agreeable
by habit. It is, in general, long before the palate
is reconciled to malt liquors; and most young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
persons prefer the sweet home-made wines of their
own country, to the richer varieties imported from
abroad. This shows that the love of such stimulants
is in a great measure acquired, and also points
out the necessity of guarding youth as much as
possible from the acquisition of so unnatural a taste.</p>

<span class="smaller">LIQUORS NOT ALWAYS HURTFUL.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Though drunkenness is always injurious, it does
not follow that a moderate and proper use of those
agents which produce it is so. These facts have
been so fully illustrated that it is unnecessary to
dwell longer upon them; and I only allude to them
at present for the purpose of showing more fully a
few circumstances in which all kinds of liquors may
be indulged in, not only without injury, but with
absolute benefit. It is impossible to deny that in
particular situations, as in those of hard-wrought
sailors and soldiers, a moderate allowance is proper.
The body, in such cases, would often sink under
the accumulation of fatigue and cold, if not recruited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
by some artificial excitement. In both the naval
and mercantile service the men are allowed a certain
quantity of grog, experience having shown the
necessity of this stimulus in such situations. When
Captain Bligh and his unfortunate companions were
exposed to those dreadful privations consequent to
their being set adrift, in an open boat, by the
mutineers of the Bounty, the few drops of rum
which were occasionally doled out to each individual,
proved of such incalculable service, that,
without this providential aid, every one must have
perished of absolute cold and exhaustion.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The
utility of spirits in enabling the frame to resist
severe cold, I can still farther illustrate by a circumstance
personal to myself; and there can be no
doubt that the experience of every one must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
furnished him with similar examples. I was travelling
on the top of the Caledonian coach, during an
intensely cold day, towards the end of November,
1821. We left Inverness at five in the morning,
when it was nearly pitch dark, and when the thermometer
probably stood at 18° of Fahr. I was
disappointed of an inside seat, and was obliged to
take one on the top, where there were nine outside
passengers besides myself, mostly sportsmen returning
from their campaigns in the moors. From
being obliged to get up so early, and without having
taken any refreshment, the cold was truly dreadful,
and set fear-noughts, fur caps, and hosiery, alike at
defiance. So situated, and whirling along at the
rate of nearly nine miles an hour, with a keen east
wind blowing upon us from the snow-covered hills,
I do not exaggerate when I say, that some of us at
least owed our lives to ardent spirits. The cold was
so insufferable, that, on arriving at the first stage,
we were nearly frozen to death. Our feet were
perfectly benumbed, and our hands, fortified as they
were with warm gloves, little better. Under such
circumstances, we all instinctively called for spirits,
and took a glass each of raw whisky, and a little
bread. The effect was perfectly magical: heat
diffused itself over the system, and we continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
comparatively warm and comfortable till our arrival
at Aviemore Inn, where we breakfasted. This
practice was repeated several times during the
journey, and always with the same good effect.
When at any time the cold became excessive, we
had recourse to our dram, which ensured us warmth
and comfort for the next twelve or fourteen miles,
without, on any occasion producing the slightest
feeling of intoxication. Nor had the spirits which
we took any bad effects either upon the other passengers
or myself. On the contrary, we were all,
so far as I could learn, much the better of it; nor
can there be a doubt, that without spirits, or some
other stimulating liquor, the consequences of such
severe weather would have been highly prejudicial
to most of us. Some persons deny that spirits possess
the property of enabling the body to resist cold,
but, in the face of such evidence, I can never agree
with them. That, under these circumstances, they
steel the system, at least for a considerable time,
against the effects of a low temperature, I am
perfectly satisfied. Analogy is in favour of this
assertion, and the experience of every man must
prove its accuracy. At the same time, I do not
mean to deny that wine or ale might have done the
same thing equally well, and perhaps with less risk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
of ulterior consequences. We had no opportunity
of trying their efficacy in these respects, and were
compelled, in self-defence, to have recourse to what,
in common cases ought to be shunned, <i>viz.</i>, raw
spirits. The case was an extreme one, and required
an extreme remedy; such, however, as I would
advise no one to have recourse to without a similar
plea of strong necessity to go upon.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that if spirits are often perverted
to the worst purposes, and capable of producing
the greatest calamities, they are also, on particular
occasions, of unquestionable benefit. In many affections,
both they and wine are of more use than any
medicine the physician can administer. Wine is
indicated in various diseases of debility. Whenever
there is a deficiency of the vital powers, as in the
low stages of typhus fever, in gangrene, putrid sore
throat, and, generally speaking, whenever weakness,
unaccompanied by acute inflammation, prevails, it
is capable of rendering the most important services.
Used in moderation, it enables the system to resist
the attack of malignant and intermittent fevers. It
is a promoter of digestion, but sometimes produces
acidity, in which case, spirits are preferable. To
assist the digestive process in weak stomachs, I
sometimes prescribe a tumbler of negus or toddy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
to be taken after dinner, especially if the person
be of a studious habit, or otherwise employed in a
sedentary occupation. Such individuals are often
benefited by the stimulus communicated to the frame
by these cordials. In diarrhœa, dysentery, cholera,
cramps, tremors, and many other diseases, both
spirits and wine often tell with admirable effect,
while they are contra-indicated in all inflammatory
affections. Malt liquors also, when used
in moderation, are often beneficial. Though the
drunkenness produced by their excessive use is of
the most stupifying and disgusting kind, yet, when
under temperate management, and accompanied by
sufficient exercise, they are more wholesome than
either spirits or wine. They abound in nourishment,
and are well adapted to the labouring man,
whose food is usually not of a very nutritive character.
The only regret is, that they are so much
adulterated by narcotics. This renders them peculiarly
improper for persons of a plethoric habit, and
also prevents them from being employed in other
cases where they might be useful. Persons of a
spare habit of body, are those likely to derive most
benefit from malt liquors. I often recommend them
to delicate youths and young girls who are just
shooting into maturity, and often with the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
effect. Lusty, full-bodied, plethoric people, should
abstain from them, at least from porter and strong ale,
which are much too fattening and nutritious for
persons of this description. They are also, generally
speaking, injurious in indigestion and bowel complaints,
owing to their tendency to produce flatulence.
In such cases, they yield the palm to wine and spirits.
It is to be regretted that the system of making
home-brewed ale, common among the English, has
made so little progress in Scotland. This excellent
beverage is free from those dangerous combinations
employed by the brewers, and to the labouring
classes in particular, is a most nourishing and salubrious
drink. I fully agree with Sir John Sinclair
in thinking, that in no respect is the alteration in
diet more injurious than in substituting ardent
spirits for ale—the ancient drink of the common
people. Though an occasional and moderate allowance
of spirits will often benefit a working man,
still the tendency of people to drink these fluids to
excess renders even their moderate indulgence often
hazardous; and hence, in one respect, the superiority
possessed over them by malt liquors.</p>

<p>In higher circles, where there is good living and
little work, liquors of any kind are far less necessary;
and, till a man gets into the decline of life,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
they are, except under such circumstances as have
been detailed, absolutely useless. When he attains
that age, he will be the better of a moderate allowance
to recruit the vigour which approaching years
steal from the frame. For young and middle-aged
men, in good circumstances and vigorous health,
water is the best drink; the food they eat being
sufficiently nutritious and stimulating without any
assistance from liquor. For young people, in
particular, liquors of all kinds are, under common
circumstances, not only unnecessary in health, but
exceedingly pernicious, even in what the world
denominate <i>moderate</i> quantities. This is especially
the case when the habit is daily indulged in. One
of the first physicians in Ireland has published his
conviction on the result of twenty years’ observation—“That
were ten young men on their twenty-first
birth day, to begin to drink one glass (equal
to two ounces) of ardent spirits, or a pint of Port
wine or Sherry, and were they to drink this <i>supposed
moderate quantity</i> of strong liquor daily, the
lives of eight out of the ten would be abridged by
twelve or fifteen years.” “An American clergyman,”
says Professor Edgar, “lately told me that
one of his parishioners was in the habit of sending
to his son at school a daily allowance of brandy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
and water, before the boy was twelve years of age.
The consequence was, that his son, before the age
of seventeen, was a confirmed drunkard, and he
is now confined in a public hospital.” The force
of this anecdote must come home to every one.
Nothing is more common, even in the best society,
than the practice of administering wine, punch, &amp;c.,
even to children—thus not only injuring their health,
and predisposing them to disease, but laying the
foundation for intemperance in their maturer years.</p>

<p>Having stated thus much, it is not to be inferred
that I advocate the banishment of liquors of any
kind from society. Though I believe mankind
would be benefited upon the whole, were such
stimulants to be utterly proscribed, yet, in the
present state of things, and knowing the fruitlessness
of any such recommendation, I do not go the
length of urging their total disuse. I only would
wish to inculcate moderation, and that in its proper
meaning, and not in the sense too often applied to
it; for, in the practice of many, moderation (so
called) is intemperance, and perhaps of the most
dangerous species, in so far as it becomes a daily
practice, and insinuates itself under a false character,
into the habits of life. Men thus indulge habitually,
day by day, not perhaps to the extent of producing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
any evident effect either upon the body or mind at
the time, and fancy themselves all the while strictly
temperate, while they are, in reality, undermining
their constitution by slow degrees—killing themselves
by inches, and shortening their existence
several years. The quantity such persons take at a
time, is perhaps moderate and beneficial, if only
occasionally indulged in, but, being habitually taken,
it injures the health, and thus amounts to actual
intemperance. “It is,” says Dr. Beecher, and I
fully concur with him, “a matter of unwonted
certainty, that habitual tippling is worse than
periodical drunkenness. The poor Indian who once
a-month drinks himself <i>dead</i>, all but simple breathing,
will outlive for years the man who drinks little
and often, and is not perhaps suspected of intemperance.
The use of ardent spirits <i>daily</i>, as ministering
to cheerfulness or bodily vigour, ought to
be regarded as intemperance. No person probably,
ever did or ever will receive ardent spirits into his
system once a-day and fortify his constitution
against its deleterious effects, or exercise such discretion
and self-government, as that the quantity
will not be increased, and bodily infirmities and
mental imbecility be the result; and, in more than
half the instances, inebriation. Nature may hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
out long against this sapping and mining of the
constitution, which daily tippling is carrying on,
but, first or last, this foe of life will bring to the
assault enemies of its own formation, before whose
power the feeble and the mighty will be alike
unable to stand.”</p>

<p>Let those, therefore, who will not abandon liquors,
use them in moderation, and not <i>habitually</i>, or <i>day
by day</i>, unless the health should require it, for cases
of this kind we sometimes do meet with, though by
no means so often as many would believe. Abstractly
considered, liquors are not injurious. It is
their abuse that makes them so, in the same manner
as the most wholesome food becomes pernicious
when taken to an improper excess.</p>

<p>“The characteristic ingredient of all wines is <i>alcohol</i>, and
the quantity of this, and the condition or state of combination
in which it exists, are the circumstances that include
all the interesting and disputed points of medical inquiry.
Daily experience convinces us that the same quantity of
alcohol, applied to the stomach under the form of natural
wine, and in a state of mixture with water, will produce
very different effects upon the body, and to an extent
which it is difficult to comprehend: it has, for instance,
been demonstrated that Port, Madeira, and Sherry contain
from one-fourth to one-fifth of their bulk of alcohol, so that
a person who takes a bottle of either of them, will thus
take nearly half a pint of alcohol, or almost a pint of pure
brandy! and moreover, that different wines, although of
the same specific gravity, and consequently containing the
same absolute proportion of spirit, will be found to vary
very considerably in their intoxicating powers; no wonder,
then, that such results should stagger the philosopher, who
is naturally unwilling to accept any tests of difference from
the nervous system, which elude the ordinary resources of
analytical chemistry; the conclusion was therefore drawn,
that alcohol must necessarily exist in wine, in a far different
condition from that in which we know it in a separate
state, or, in other words, that its elements only could
exist in the vinous liquor, and that their union was determined,
and, consequently, alcohol produced by the action<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
of distillation. That it was <i>product</i> and not the <i>educt</i>
of distillation, was an opinion which originated with
Rouelle, who asserted that alcohol was not completely
formed until the temperature was raised to the point of
distillation: more lately, the same doctrine was revived
and promulgated by Fabbronni, in the memoirs of the Florentine
Academy. Gay-Lussac has, however, silenced the
clamorous partisans of this theory, by separating the
alcohol by distillation at the temperature of 66° Fah., and
by the aid of a vacuum, it has since been effected at 56°;
besides, it has been shown that by precipitating the colouring
matter, and some of the other elements of the wine,
by <i>sub-acetate</i> of <i>lead</i>, and then saturating the clear liquor
with <i>sub-carbonate</i> of <i>potass</i>, the alcohol may be completely
separated without any elevation of temperature;
and by this ingenious expedient, Mr. Brande has been
enabled to construct a table, exhibiting the proportions
of combined alcohol which exist in the several kinds of
wine: no doubt, therefore, can remain upon this subject,
and the fact of the difference of the effect, produced by the
same bulk of alcohol, when presented to the stomach in
different states of combination, adds another striking and
instructive illustration to those already enumerated in the
course of this work, of the extraordinary powers of
chemical combination in modifying the activity of substances
upon the living system. In the present instance,
the alcohol is so combined with the extractive matter of
the wine, that it is probably incapable of exerting its full
specific effects upon the stomach, before it becomes
altered in its properties, or, in other words, <i>digested</i>; and
this view of the subject may be fairly urged in explanation
of the reason why the intoxicating effects of the same
wine are so liable to vary, in degree, in the same individual,
from the peculiar state of his digestive organs at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
time of his potation. Hitherto we have only spoken of
pure wine, but it is essential to state, that the stronger,
wines of Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, are rendered remarkable
in this country by the addition of brandy, and must
consequently contain <i>uncombined</i> alcohol, the proportion
of which, however, will not necessarily bear a ratio to the
quantity added, because, at the period of its admixture, a
renewed fermentation is produced by the scientific vintner,
which will assimilate and combine a certain portion of the
foreign spirit with the wine: this manipulation, in technical
language, is called <i>fretting-in</i>. The free alcohol may,
according to the experiments of Fabbronni, be immediately
separated by saturating the vinous fluid with <i>sub-carbonate</i>
of <i>potass</i>, while the combined portion will remain undisturbed:
in ascertaining the fabrication and salubrity of a
wine, this circumstance ought always to constitute a leading
feature in the inquiry; and the tables of Mr. Brande
would have been greatly enhanced in practical value, had
the relative proportions of <i>uncombined</i> spirit been appreciated
in his experiments, since it is to this, and not to the
<i>combined</i> alcohol that the injurious effects of wine are to
be attributed. ‘It is well known,’ observes Dr. Macculloch,
‘that diseases of the liver are the most common, and the
most formidable of those produced by the use of <i>ardent</i>
spirits; it is equally certain that no such disorders follow
the intemperate use of <i>pure</i> wine, however long indulged
in: to the concealed and unwitting consumption of spirit,
therefore, as contained in the wines commonly drunk in
this country, is to be attributed the excessive prevalence
of those hepatic affections, which are comparatively little
known to our continental neighbours.’ Thus much is
certain, that their ordinary wines contain no alcohol but
what is disarmed of its virulence by the prophylactic
energies of combination.”</p>

north of the equator; for as we proceed to the south of
that line, the vice increases precisely in the same manner as
in the opposite direction. To use the words of Montesquieu;
“Go from the equator to our pole, and you will find drunkenness
increasing together with the degree of latitude. Go
from the same equator to the opposite pole, and you will find
drunkenness travelling south, as on this side it travels towards
the north.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The quantity of wine raised in France alone is almost incredible.
The vineyards in that country are said to occupy five
millions of acres, or a twenty-sixth part of the whole territory.
Paris alone consumes more than three times the quantity of
wine consumed in the British Isles. It is true that much of
the wine drunk in the French capital is of a weak quality,
being used as a substitute for small beer. But after every
allowance is made, enough remains to show clearly, if other
proofs were wanting, how much the use of wine here is
restricted by our exorbitant duties. It would be well for the
morals of this country if the people abandoned the use of
ardent spirits, and were enabled to resort to such wines as the
French are in the habit of drinking.</p>

There is nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man.
Yet a coward is worse than a cup of Sack with lime in it.”—Lime,
it is well known, is added to the grapes in the manufacture
of Sherry. This not only gives the wine what is called
its dry quality, but probably acts by neutralizing a portion of
the malic or tartaric acid.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> The following description, by a modern traveller, of a scene
witnessed by him in the East, gives a lively picture of the effects
of this drug:—</p>

<p>“There is a decoction of the head and seeds of the poppy,
which they call Coquenar, for the sale of which there are
taverns in every quarter of the town, similar to our coffee-houses.
It is extremely amusing to visit these houses, and to
observe carefully those who resort there for the purpose of
drinking it, both before they have taken the dose, before it begins
to operate, and while it is operating. On entering the tavern,
they are dejected and languishing: soon after they have taken
two or three cups of this beverage, they are peevish, and as it
were, enraged; every thing displeases them. They find fault
with every thing, and quarrel with one another, but in the
course of its operation they make it up again;—and, each one
giving himself up to his predominant passion, the lover speaks
sweet things to his idol—another, half asleep, laughs in his sleeve—a
third talks big and blusters—a fourth tells ridiculous stories.
In a word, a person would believe himself to be really in a
mad-house. A kind of lethargy and stupidity succeed to this
disorderly gaiety; but the Persians, far from treating it as it
deserves, call it an ecstasy, and maintain that there is something
exquisite and heavenly in this state.”—<i>Chardin.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> “Tobacco,” King James farther observes, “is the lively
image and pattern of hell, for it hath, by allusion, in it all the
parts and vices of the world, whereby hell may be gained; to
wit, first, it is a smoke; so are all the vanities of this world.
Secondly, it delighteth them that take it; so do all the pleasures
of the world delight the men of the world. Thirdly, it maketh
men <i>drunken</i> and light in the head; so do all the vanities of the
world, men are drunken therewith. Fourthly, he that taketh
tobacco cannot leave it; it doth bewitch him; even so the pleasures
of the world make men loath to leave them; they are, for
the most part, enchanted with them. And, farther, besides all
this, it is like hell in the very substance of it, for it is a stinking
loathsome thing, and so is hell.” And, moreover, his majesty

essential oil of tobacco operates very differently from the infusion.
The former acts instantly on the heart, suspending its
action, even while the animal continues to inspire, and destroying
life by producing syncope. The latter appears to operate
solely on the brain, leaving the circulation unaffected.</p>

doctrine:—“1. In experiments where animals have been killed
by the injection of spirits into the stomach, I have found this
organ to bear the marks of great inflammation, but never any
preternatural appearances whatever in the brain. 2. The effects
of spirits taken into the stomach, in the last experiment, were so
instantaneous, that it appears impossible that absorption should
have taken place before they were produced. 3. A person
who is intoxicated frequently becomes suddenly sober after
vomiting. 4. In the experiments which I have just related,
I mixed tincture of rhubarb with the spirits, knowing, from the
experiments of Mr. Home and Mr. William Brande, that this
(<i>rhubarb</i>) when absorbed into the circulation, was readily
separated from the blood by the kidneys, and that very small
quantities might be detected in the urine by the addition of
potash; but though I never failed to find urine in the bladder,
I never detected rhubarb in it.”—<i>Phil. Trans. of the Roy.

species of delirium that often attends the accession of <i>typhus

ebriety. Among seamen and soldiers, whose habits of intoxication
are common, it will sometimes require nice discernment to
decide; for the vacant stare in the countenance, the look of
idiotism, incoherent speech, faltering voice, and tottering walk,
are so alike in both cases, that the naval and military surgeon
ought at all times to be very cautious how he gives up a man
to punishment, under these suspicious appearances. Nay, the
circumstance of his having come from a tavern, with even the
effluvium of liquor about him, are signs not always to be
trusted; for these haunts of seamen and soldiers are often the

<p>“The laws against intoxication are enforced with great
rigour in Sweden. Whoever is seen drunk, is fined, for the first
offence, three dollars; for the second, six; for the third and
fourth, a still larger sum, and is also deprived of the right of
voting at elections, and of being appointed a representative.
He is, besides, publicly exposed in the parish church on the
following Sunday. If the same individual is found committing
the same offence a fifth time, he is shut up in a house of correction,
and condemned to six months’ hard labour; and if he
is again guilty, of a twelvemonth’s punishment of a similar
description. If the offence has been committed in public, such
as at a fair, an auction, &amp;c., the fine is doubled; and if the
offender has made his appearance in a church, the punishment
is still more severe. Whoever is convicted of having induced
another to intoxicate himself, is fined three dollars, which sum is
doubled if the person is a minor. An ecclesiastic who falls into
this offence loses his benefice: if it is a layman who occupies
any considerable post, his functions are suspended, and perhaps
he is dismissed. Drunkenness is never admitted as an excuse
for any crime; and whoever dies when drunk is buried ignominiously,
and deprived of the prayers of the church. It is
forbidden to give, and more explicitly to sell, any spirituous
liquors to students, workmen, servants, apprentices, and private
soldiers. Whoever is observed drunk in the streets, or making
a noise in a tavern, is sure to be taken to prison and detained
till sober, without, however, being on that account exempted
from the fines. Half of these fines goes to the informers, (who
are generally police officers,) the other half to the poor. If the
delinquent has no money, he is kept in prison until some one
pays for him, or until he has worked out his enlargement.
Twice a-year these ordinances are read aloud from the pulpit
by the clergy; and every tavern-keeper is bound, under the
penalty of a heavy fine, to have a copy of them hung up in
the principal rooms of his house.”—<i>Schubert’s Travels in
Sweden.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> The following account of Temperance Societies is by Professor
Edgar, one of their most enthusiastic advocates:—</p>

<p>“Temperance Societies direct their chief exertions against
the use of distilled spirits, conceiving them to be the great bane
of the community; but they do not exclude these to introduce
other intoxicating liquors in their room. Their object is to
disabuse the public mind respecting the erroneous opinions
and evil practices which produce and perpetuate intemperance;
and though they do not hold it to be sinful to drink wine, yet
they are cheerfully willing to accord with the sentiment of
inspiration—‘It is good neither to drink wine nor any thing
whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made
weak.’ Were the wine spoken of in Scripture alone used in
these countries, they do not believe that there would be a
necessity for Temperance Societies; yet even from such wine,
so different from that commonly in use, the Scriptures gave
them the fullest liberty to refrain. Avoiding, however, all
appearance of rigorous abstinence, they leave to every man’s
judgment and conscience, how far he shall feel himself warranted
in the use of fermented liquors, and only insist, as their
fundamental principle, on an abstinence from distilled spirits,
and a discountenancing of the causes and practices of intemperance.
Their regulations respect persons in health alone;
with the prescriptions of physicians they do not interfere.
Even the moderate use of distilled spirits they consider to be
injurious; and they call upon their brethren, for their own
sake, to renounce it. The great mass of excellences attributed
to intoxicating liquors, they believe to be fictitious; and though
all the virtues attributed to them were real, they are cheerfully
willing to sacrifice them, while they have the remotest hope of
thus cutting off even one of the sources of drunkenness, or
arresting one friend or neighbour on the road to ruin. They
do not look on the use of intoxicating liquors as necessary
either to their health or happiness; they do not love them, and
therefore, they do not wish to represent an abstinence from
them as, on their part, a great sacrifice; and they trust that
they only require to be convinced that the good of their brother
demands it, to induce them to do much more than they have
yet done. They know that the only prospect of reformation
for the intemperate is immediate and complete abstinence, and
they joyfully contribute their influence and example to save
him. They know that the present customs and practices of
the temperate, are now preparing a generation for occupying
the room of those who shall soon sleep in drunkards’ graves,
and it is their earnest wish to exercise such a redeeming influence
on the public mind, that, should the present race of
drunkards refuse to be saved, there may be none to fill their
place when they are no more. The abstinence of the temperate,
they are convinced, will accomplish this, and that abstinence it
is their business to promote by those means with which the
God of truth has furnished them. They believe that such
abstinence, instead of being productive of any injury to the
community will greatly benefit it; and already there are the
fairest prospects of the great objects of such voluntary abstinence
being effected, by associations sustaining one another in
new habits, to make them reputable and common. They
require no oaths, no vows; their bond of obligation is a sense
of duty, and subscription to their fundamental principle, is
merely an expression of present conviction and determination.
The law of Temperance Societies, like the Gospel, is the law of
liberty—the law which binds to do that which is considered a
delight and a privilege. They look forward to the time as not
far distant, when the temperate having withdrawn their support
from the trade in ardent spirits, it shall be deserted by all
respectable men, and shall gradually die away, as premature
death thins the ranks of drunkards: they trust that the falsehoods
by which temperate men have been cheated into the
ordinary use of ardent spirits, will soon be completely exposed;
and that full information and proper feeling being extended,
respecting the nature and effects of intoxicating liquors, they
will occupy their proper place, and the unnumbered blessings
of temperance on individuals and families, and the whole community,
will universally prevail. Not only will Temperance
Societies cut off the resources of drunkenness, but to the
reformed drunkard, they will open a refuge from the tyranny
of evil customs, and they will support and encourage him in
his new habits. To promote these invaluable objects, they
call for the united efforts of all temperate men; they
earnestly solicit the assistance of physicians, of clergymen, of
the conductors of public journals, of all men possessing authority
and influence; and by every thing sacred and good, they
beseech drunkards to turn from the wickedness of their ways
and live.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> The origin of the term “grog” is curious. Before the time
of Admiral Vernon, rum was given in its raw state to the
seamen; but he ordered it to be diluted, previous to delivery,
with a certain quantity of water. So incensed were the tars at
this watering of their favourite liquor, that they nicknamed the
Admiral <i>Old Grog</i>, in allusion to a grogram coat which he was
in the habit of wearing: hence the name.</p>

that we could scarcely move them.”</p>

<p>“Being unusually wet and cold, I served to the people a
tea-spoonful of rum each, to enable them to bear with their
distressing situation.”</p>

<p>“Our situation was miserable: always wet, and suffering
extreme cold in the night, without the least shelter from the
weather. The little rum we had was of the <i>greatest service</i>;
when our nights were particularly distressing, I generally
served a tea-spoonful or two to each person, and it was always
joyful tidings when they heard of my intention.”—<i>Family

</div>

<p>The object the publisher had in view in projecting these little
works was to produce a Series of distinct Treatises on all subjects
of general interest—in the smallest possible compass, and at
the smallest possible price. How far he has been successful in
carrying into effect what he projected, may be learned in the gratifying
fact, that since the first appearance of the series in 1834,
upwards of</p>

<p class="center">TWENTY THOUSAND COPIES</p>

<p class="noindent">have been purchased by the public. From this it will be seen the
Editor of the <i>Dumfries Courier</i>, in reviewing them, was not far
wrong in saying the publisher was “<i>the most extensive Pocket Guide
Book maker in the three Kingdoms</i>.” In his usual happy style he
added they were the best exemplification he had seen of the best
maxim of the Bentham school, viz.—<i>the maximum of utility in the
minimum of space</i>.</p>

<p>The Tourist’s Guide, and the Guide to the Picturesque Scenery
of Scotland, are books that have been much wanted. They do not
profess to give a detailed History of Scotland, nor yet a detailed
History of the Highlands, like all their predecessors in this department
of literature, but to Guide the Tourist to all that is worthy
of his admiration. A very minute description of this is given;
and that is all that one wants when they set out on a travelling
excursion. Their size adapts them peculiarly for this purpose;
they are hand books, in fact, that cannot incommode a lady in her
reticule, or a gentleman in his vest pocket.</p>

<p>From the great sale which this work continued to have, long
after the completion of the Series, the proprietors were induced to
have the whole of it revised throughout from the commencement.
In doing this, the plan they adopted was to exclude any article
which appeared of less value to the scientific inquirer, and such as
were more of a temporary interest. They are happy to say this has
met with the approbation of the public, by a sale <i>unprecedented in
the annals of periodical literature</i>. The work should, in fact, be
now viewed more in the light of</p>

<p class="center">“A STANDARD BODY OF PRACTICAL SCIENCE,”</p>

<p class="noindent">which it in reality is, than in that of “a Magazine” of the times,
the utility of which, in most cases, lasts but for a day. The most
eminent scientific men have contributed to these volumes, and
numerous have been the laudatory notices from all quarters, that
have appeared of it. Amongst numerous others which might be
adduced, they may mention, that the celebrated Dr. Gregory, in his
Mathematics for Practical Men, quotes numerous articles from it,
and refers his readers to “<i>that useful publication</i>.” Lord Brougham
characterises the work as having been “<i>carried on with great spirit</i>;”
and he farther adds, that he found it “<i>remarkably full of useful information</i>,”
no small recommendation from an authority so high.
The <i>Leeds Mercury</i>, under the management of Mr. Baines, M.P.,
among a host of other Journals which reviewed this work, in noticing
it, remarked, “It appears to be conducted by a set of practical
men, who understand well what they are about, and who are well
calculated to execute the task they have undertaken.”</p>

support of the most eminent and talented Clergy of the Church of
Scotland, and of the sound and well-affected portion of the Seceding
Ministers, as well as the right-minded Laity in the Church and
among Dissenters. It originated at a period of the most violent
hostility to the settled institutions both of Church and State. It
entered on the defence with the boldness, decision, and energy of
truth, and continues to be carried on with a nerve and vigour
worthy of the noble cause in which it is embarked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Friends of the Connexion of Church and State</span> will
find in it every variety of argument drawn from Scripture and
reason—from history and experience—from the nature of man, and
the necessities of human society, in proof of the duty and expediency
of maintaining that connexion. They will obtain ample and
minute statistical information on all the great facts of the question,
both as relating to the Church and Dissenters in Scotland—the
revenues and numbers of the Church and Dissenters in England—the
past and present state of the Church in Ireland—its property
and numbers—and the present condition of Popery and Presbyterianism
in that country. The numerous able papers of the Rev.
Mr. Lorimer which it contains on the state of the question, in
America, it is confessed, on all hands, are <i>unequalled and unanswerable</i>.
The able series of papers by Captain Gordon have been generally
admired; while the not less talented and vigorous contributions
from the pen of the Editor have called forth universal
commendation, extending even to those hostile to the cause.</p>

<p>The Publisher again repeats his unhesitating conviction, that, in
no other work of the same compass, will the Churchman find so
complete an armour for the sound defence of Church Establishments.</p>

<p class="center bold">A Catechism of Phrenology,</p>

<p class="center">Illustrative of the Principles of that Science. By a Member of the
Phrenological Society of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>“Since the publication of the first edition of this Catechism, in
1831, the science of Phrenology has taken an astonishing hold upon
the public mind. This is attributable, no doubt, chiefly to the
intrinsic value of the science itself; but it is also partly owing to
the means that have been adopted to render the science known to the
mass of society. This Catechism, from its comprehensiveness,
admitted accuracy, cheapness and portability, has been in no slight
degree conducive to this end. Both Author and Publisher have
reason to be proud of the success of the book. Within the last six
years 12,000 copies have been sold; and the <i>increasing sale</i> of the
work not only indicate the high estimation in which it is held, but
also the ardent longing of the public for phrenological knowledge.
In this edition the Author and Publisher have made some alterations
and additions, both in the getting up and matter of the book,
which they hope will render it still more worthy of public
patronage.”—<i>Preface to the Twelfth Edition.</i></p>

<p>“The utility of this manual is unquestionable, for whatever
progress the science it is intended to illustrate may be making,
it is evident that, its study should not be entirely omitted even
in the most general education. The arrangement of the work is
admirable. The utmost perspicuity prevails in every page. The
public may be assured of its high claims to their attention, from
the facility with which the principles of the science are unfolded
before them; from the philosophic tone in which the subject is
treated, and from the unassuming, modest manner in which its
appeals are made.”—<i>Alexander’s East India Magazine.</i></p>

<p>“We are happy to announce a fifth edition of this most useful and
intelligent work. The author, Mr. Robert Macnish, has done more
service to the cause of sobriety, by describing in this book the
lamentable results of immoderate indulgence in intoxicating fluids,
than all the Temperance Societies in England. In fact, if Mr.
Buckingham and his fellow-twaddlers of the celebrated drunken
committee, instead of recommending absurd and impracticable legal
enactments for the prevention of drunkenness, had prevailed on
parliament to grant a sum of money for the dissemination of
Macnish’s ‘Anatomy,’ they would have taken the most effectual
means to check an evil which is really of a sad and devastating
character. We remember once hearing a worthy gentleman advise
an unhappy infidel to read Bishop Watson’s reply to Tom Paine’s
Age of Reason, remarking, ‘if you study that book, Sir, you
cannot be an unbeliever.’ Without seeking to weaken the force
of the good Christian’s injunction, <i>we</i> say to all who are in danger
of contracting the truly horrible habit of intoxication, read Macnish
on Drunkenness.”—<i>London Weekly Despatch.</i></p>

simpler questions are left without any answer, so that the children
may exercise their own ingenuity in solving them. This we think
a decided improvement. We are glad also to see so considerable a
portion of it devoted to an account of the Books of Scripture, and
to an explanation of some of the most important words which
frequently occur in them. We are quite sure that this will be
found extremely useful ‘in fixing the outline of Scripture History
in the youthful mind, and in exciting the desire of a more extensive
acquaintance with the Inspired Records.’ While we can very
strongly recommend this Catechism to schools for the use of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
